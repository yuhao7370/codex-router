# Coding client logo sources

These local assets identify supported coding clients in the Codex Router control
center. They are bundled with the app and are never hotlinked at runtime.

| Local asset | Used for | Official brand or product page | Asset source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cursor.svg`, `cursor-dark.svg` | Cursor | https://cursor.com/brand | `General Logos/Cube/SVG/CUBE_2D_LIGHT.svg` and `CUBE_2D_DARK.svg` from Cursor's official downloadable brand asset archive |
| `deepseek-harness.svg` | DeepSeek Harness | https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness | `packages/client/ui-primitives/src/FishLogo.tsx` from the official DeepSeek Harness repository |
| `codex-light.svg`, `codex-dark.svg` | Codex | https://developers.openai.com/ | Dedicated `icon-codex-light.png` and `icon-codex-dark-color.png` product assets bundled in the installed official OpenAI desktop app, mechanically downsampled for this 23px surface |
| `claude.svg` | Claude Code | https://claude.com/product/claude-code | Exact orange Claude mark bundled in the installed official Anthropic Claude app (`ion-dist/assets/v1/cd02a42d9-Vq_H3mgS.svg`) |
| `openclaw.svg` | OpenClaw | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw | Official `docs/assets/pixel-lobster.svg` from the OpenClaw repository |
| `pi.svg` | pi | https://pi.dev/ | The official `favicon.svg` served by pi.dev, reflowed onto one line and otherwise unchanged |
| `omp.svg` | omp (oh-my-pi) | https://omp.sh/ | Official `assets/icon.svg` from the can1357/oh-my-pi repository, with its fills replaced by `currentColor` for the mask below |

Three client rows reuse a mark this app already bundles for the same
organization as a *provider*, rather than committing a second copy of it:
opencode uses `../providers/opencode.png`, Command Code uses
`../providers/commandcode.svg`, and Hermes Agent uses
`../providers/nousresearch.png`. Their provenance is recorded in
`../providers/SOURCES.md`.

DeepSeek Harness's and omp's official components are rendered as current-colour
masks. omp's mark is drawn for a dark ground, so painting it in the surrounding
text colour is what keeps it legible in both themes.
Cursor and Codex retain their official light/dark artwork. All names, logos, and trademarks remain
the property of their respective owners. Their use here identifies compatible
clients and does not imply endorsement or affiliation.
