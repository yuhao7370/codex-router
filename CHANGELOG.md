# Changelog

## Unreleased
- **A connect timeout is bounded now, and the retry that exists to absorb it is
  finally reachable.** `upstream-retry.mjs` has always listed
  `UND_ERR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` as retryable, but its pre-retry budget was a fixed
  5s while the socket was allowed undici's 10s default to connect: by the time
  the failure arrived, the attempt had already spent the budget, so the retry
  never started and the blip was relayed as a 502. One incident across two
  machines (2026-09-21) logged 454 connect timeouts and *zero* connect retries,
  each failure costing its caller 10.2s. The process-wide pool now carries an
  explicit `connectTimeout` (3s; `CODEX_ROUTER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` to tune,
  clamped 0.5-30s) and races the resolved addresses (`autoSelectFamily`, 250ms
  per attempt) instead of serializing one dead anycast IP in front of a healthy
  one, and `upstream-retry.mjs` derives its default budget from the same bound
  (`3 x connectTimeout`, 9s by default) so the two cannot drift apart again.
  The worst case for a request that does fail is unchanged at ~10s -- three
  bounded attempts plus backoff, where one undici-default attempt used to be --
  and a slow failure is still relayed untouched: the 504 an edge spends half a
  minute producing is not retried. Measured against a blackholed address, a
  connect failure is now detected at 3.5s instead of 10.0s.
  (`CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_RETRIES`, `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS` and
  `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_RETRY_BUDGET_MS` still tune the loop; `0` disables it.)
- **An overloaded machine no longer makes the router kill a working LiteLLM
  gateway.** The liveness watchdog stopped the gateway after three missed 4 s
  probes, and it treated a probe that *timed out* the same as one that was
  *refused*. With a load average in the hundreds, a healthy gateway that was
  still streaming a routed turn missed those probes. The kill cut the turn off
  partway through its reasoning, and the replacement could not finish importing
  within its 5-minute cold-start budget under the same load. It was then killed
  and restarted from scratch, so every routed model answered `502 ... the
  upstream refused the connection` for minutes. Now only refusals trip the
  short fuse. Timeouts need 20 in a row
  (`CODEX_ROUTER_GATEWAY_HEALTH_STALL_FAILURES`), and a replacement that is
  still running gets up to three cold-start budgets before it is restarted.
- **ClinePass models no longer break the Codex model catalog.** To hide the
  effort selector ClinePass cannot honor, the catalog dropped
  `supported_reasoning_levels` from ClinePass entries, but Codex requires that
  key: with it missing, Codex failed to parse the whole `model_catalog_json`
  with `missing field supported_reasoning_levels`. ClinePass entries now publish
  an empty ladder, which hides the selector and stays schema-valid. The router
  still strips `reasoning_effort`, `thinking`, and `top_p` before forwarding to
  ClinePass. (#870)
- **MiMo on opencode Go now accepts pasted images and uses its full window.**
  The V2.6 Flash, V2.6 Pro, and V2.5 routes were shipped text-only because
  OpenCode published no modalities for them at the time; OpenCode's own
  metadata (the `opencode-go` provider on models.dev) now lists image input,
  and a live image request answered correctly on all three. V2.6 Flash, V2.6
  Pro, and V2.5 Pro also move from the 1,000,000-token fallback to the
  1,048,576 window that catalog publishes -- the figure every other V2.6 route
  already uses -- with compaction at 900,000. V2.5 Pro stays text-only, as
  published.
- **A stopped local gateway no longer tells you to configure a proxy.** When
  the router's own LiteLLM gateway on `127.0.0.1:4200` was down (for example
  restarting under heavy machine load), requests failed with "the upstream
  refused the connection" and advice to set `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`. A refused
  socket names its host in `address`, not `hostname`, so the router never saw
  that the host was loopback. It now reads that field, and the error says
  `127.0.0.1 refused the connection` with the `./bin/doctor --fix` hint for
  the install's own processes.
- **Installing no longer tells you to quit a Codex that is already closed.**
  Quitting the desktop app leaves Chromium's crash reporter
  (`browser_crashpad_handler`) running for hours, reparented to launchd, under
  the Codex Framework path the running-client check matches, so the install
  named it as "Codex is running right now". Crash reporters are no longer
  counted on macOS, Linux, or Windows, and a listing made only of helper
  processes -- the residue of an app that already quit -- reports the client as
  not running. A running app is still named by its main process. On Windows,
  Cursor's quoted executable path is now recognized too.
- **Adding a provider key now shows the connection being made instead of
  nothing at all.** Saving a credential runs one router command that writes the
  key, enables the provider, and republishes every installed client's catalog
  before the refreshed snapshot can report the routes it unlocked -- and the
  dialog closes the moment you submit, so for the length of that command the
  Models page was identical either side of the key being accepted and the click
  read as having done nothing. The provider's chip now moves onto the
  connections strip with a spinner and "Connecting...", and every route waiting
  on it swaps its Connect button for the same word plus a blank the size of the
  switch that is about to arrive. Signing in and disconnecting report the same
  way. Placement is optimistic; the connected count is not, so a provider still
  publishing sits among the chips without being counted as connected. The
  placeholder is cleared by the same await that already reconciled the
  snapshot, including when the command fails, so it can never outlive the work
  it describes or fall back to the state it replaced.
- **Models you select no longer vanish from the desktop picker on large catalogs.**
  The ChatGPT desktop app reads a single 100-entry page of Codex's
  `model/list`, which Codex serves in priority order with hidden entries
  included, and never asks for the next page. The published catalog
  interleaved hidden routes with visible ones by priority, so on this host a
  selected Step 5 Preview landed at entry 107 and never reached the picker while
  the CLI listed it. Hidden entries are now published in a priority band after
  the last visible model; visible priorities, and therefore the picker order
  and the spawn_agent override window, are unchanged.
- **OpenCode Free models that the provider will not serve to this router are no
  longer offered.** OpenCode answers a free-tier request that did not come from
  its own client with `FreeTierError: OpenCode's free tier can only be used from
  within OpenCode`, so curating one produced a picker entry that failed on its
  opening request. Probed 2026-09-23 against `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1` in the
  shape the router uses -- no credential, the `x-opencode-session` header,
  Chat Completions for the primary ids and Responses for the Muse pair --
  `big-pickle`, `mimo-v2.5-free`, `mimo-v2.6-flash-free`,
  `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free`, `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`,
  `nemotron-3-ultra-free`, and `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` are all refused
  that way; `deepseek-v4-flash-free` cleared the same gate on the same run and
  stays addable, which is why the list is per id rather than a provider-wide
  rule. Discovery now reports each gated id as blocked with that reason instead
  of as a candidate, and `doctor` says so where it suggests curating the free
  tier. An id already in an operator's configuration is untouched and still
  resolves to its documented route.
- **A locally curated model can now be deleted from the Control Center.**
  Routes that came from the `user-models.json` overlay are tagged `Local` on
  the Models page and carry a delete control that asks for confirmation; the
  router resolves each slug against the overlay and runs
  `curate-models PROVIDER --remove ... --apply`, so a checked-in route can
  never be offered for deletion. `curate-models` also gains `--dry-run`,
  which prints what a run would add or remove without writing anything.
- **A long session's images can no longer cross the provider's ceiling and fail
  the whole turn.** A conversation replays every image it still holds on every
  following turn, so a session that views screenshots grows until one request
  exceeds OpenRouter's limit of 30MB of decoded image content -- measured on
  this host 2026-09-17 at about 12MB accepted and 31MB refused with `413`, on a
  Kalaam worker whose session had reached 1,791 image references. The routed
  path now bounds the payload after tool-result aging: oldest images become
  short text receipts until the request fits both a 20MB byte budget and a 128K
  image-token budget, keeping the newest two images always. The byte cap stops
  the stall; the token cap, charged at the route's per-image bound (4096 on a
  resold route against 1024 on the documented direct DeepSeek Flash models),
  bounds the per-turn bill that the byte cap alone does not. Images inside tool
  results are bounded too, remote image URLs are not measured, and the counts --
  seen, dropped, bytes and tokens saved -- are recorded in the usage event.
- **Switching native models no longer carries an unsupported reasoning effort
  into the next turn.** Codex can apply the newly selected model before it
  replaces the previous model's effort, so moving from a model with a
  `minimal` rung to GPT-6 Astra, GPT-5.6 Sol, or GPT-5.6 Luna sent an invalid
  model/effort pair and ChatGPT rejected the whole turn with HTTP 400. Native
  passthrough now checks the target model's current account-catalog ladder and
  clamps only known Codex effort names onto it. Already-supported values remain
  unchanged, unknown values still reach the upstream validator, and a missing
  or unreadable catalog remains fail-open.
- **Direct Meta Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor no longer loses tool-bearing turns
  to a recursive schema the repair never reached.** Issue #792 opted that route
  into the cycle-closing repair, but the repair ran only in the api-forwarder,
  which understands top-level `type: "function"` tools. Meta is a
  Responses-native endpoint, so the router deliberately keeps Codex's
  `type: "namespace"` entries, and the recursion lives inside those children --
  the `codex_app` and connector toolsets, where `$defs` re-enters itself
  (`__schema0`, and the Gmail-style `MessagePartRequest.parts`). Those turns
  still came back as HTTP 400 `Recursive JSON schemas are not currently
  supported` while the forwarder's own log stayed silent, which is what made it
  read like a stale config. The router now runs the same repair for any route
  that documents `toolSchemaRecursion: "flatten"` on itself, in the shape its
  endpoint validates. That also closes the same latent gap on
  `opencode-go-responses/muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, which carries the flag
  without being named in the gate. Sibling Meta routes still keep their
  payloads until their own endpoint proves the restriction (#792), and
  Moonshot-flavored routes keep their own pass, where a blanked cycle-closing
  reference has to retain the type it declared.
- **One tool name never stands for two tools on a chat route, and a live schema
  always wins over a discovered one.** Two halves of the same collision.
  `chatProviderToolSurface` asked `flattenNamespaceTools` for deterministic
  aliases only on the Groq route, so every unbounded chat provider published
  two distinct native identities under one name: Codex injects its app tools as
  a `codex_app` namespace and also sends the flattened spelling, so a client
  carrying `codex_app__create_thread` beside the namespaced `create_thread` had
  that name sent upstream twice, its own tool unreachable for the turn, and the
  past call it had made restored under the namespaced identity Codex dispatches
  elsewhere. The other half ran the opposite way: `flattenToolSearchHistory`
  states that live top-level schemas win on a name collision, but it compared
  provider-facing names, so exactly the routes that do alias -- Groq and
  Command Code -- handed the discovered tool a different name, stopped seeing
  the collision, and declared a stale searched schema beside the live one. The
  shadow check now compares the live tools' own wire spellings, which is what a
  discovery collides with. Every chat route now behaves the same way on both,
  with the aliases Groq and Command Code already minted. Asking for the aliases
  changes nothing where there is no collision: across 20,000 generated
  collision-free tool lists the flattened output is byte-identical either way.
- **A turn the router sent twice is metered at what both attempts cost.**
  `mergeTokenUsage` exists to add up two attempts at one turn -- "a turn the
  router had to send twice cost twice; the meter has to say so" -- and added up
  every field except the two that carry what was actually billed.
  `billedInputTokens` and `billedOutputTokens` were dropped when both attempts
  reported, while being kept when only one did. `provider-usage.mjs` reads
  `billedInputTokens ?? inputTokens`, so the Usage view fell back to the
  reported prompt on exactly the turns where the two differ: a Grok OAuth
  progress-only repair whose upstream billed 301,000 input tokens was shown as
  101,000. Both are now summed like the cache and reasoning counts, absent when
  neither attempt reported one, and a measured zero still survives.
- **A replayed tool call with no arguments no longer kills a Meta Muse Spark
  thread.** Meta validates a function call's `arguments` as JSON and refuses the
  whole request with HTTP 400 `` `arguments` must be valid JSON `` before
  inference, so the turn is lost — and because the call stays in the transcript,
  every later turn in that thread is lost with it. Measured live: Muse called an
  MCP tool with no arguments at all, the server answered "pattern is required",
  Codex recorded the call with `arguments: ""`, and the next request died on
  replay. Meta-bound requests now turn an absent, empty, or whitespace-only
  argument string into `{}`, which is what the call meant and what the endpoint
  accepts. The repair is deliberately narrow: a non-empty string that is not
  JSON is a different failure and is left exactly as it arrived, and each
  substitution is reported rather than quieted.
- **Grok 4.7 ships on all six providers that serve it.** xAI published
  `grok-4.7` on 2026-09-21 with the same 500,000-token window, text + image
  input, and low/medium/high/xhigh effort ladder as 4.6, and it is now a
  checked-in route on `grok-oauth`, `grok-api`, `commandcode` (`xai/grok-4.7`),
  `nousresearch` and `openrouter` (`x-ai/grok-4.7`), and opencode Go's
  Responses surface. Each entry takes its ladder and modalities from that
  provider's own catalog rather than from the family name: Command Code
  publishes no parameter metadata and so keeps low/medium/high, while every
  other route carries xAI's documented `xhigh`. All four rungs were checked
  live on `grok-oauth/grok-4.7`. None of the six claims `multiAgentVersion: "v2"` — a native collaboration
  proof is not inherited from a certified 4.5 sibling — and the grok-oauth
  route does not inherit 4.6's Fast service tier either.
- **OpenRouter's Grok routes regain the `xhigh` rung they always had.** The
  checked-in `openrouter/grok-4.6` ladder was copied from Command Code's entry
  rather than read from OpenRouter, so it published low/medium/high. OpenRouter
  documents `xhigh` in the accepted effort vocabulary and maps an unsupported
  rung down instead of rejecting it, its `/models` record for `x-ai/grok-4.6`
  and `x-ai/grok-4.7` advertises `reasoning_effort` among the supported
  parameters, and xAI documents `xhigh` as a native rung of both models. Both
  OpenRouter entries now carry the fourth rung. Command Code publishes no
  parameter metadata for its Grok route and stays conservative, which is now
  recorded as its own reason rather than as the precedent the other route was
  copied from.
- **The Grok OAuth bridge's per-model adaptations moved into one list.** The
  literal `"grok-oauth/grok-4.6"` used to be repeated across the forwarder, the
  router, the tool facade, the structured-patch and patch-hook experiments, and
  request diagnostics, so adding a Grok model meant finding all of them.
  `src/grok-oauth-routes.mjs` now holds the routes that run those workarounds,
  and the two facts the registry already knows — whether a route has an `xhigh`
  rung and whether it offers a service tier — are read back from the model
  entry the way hosted search always was. A second Grok model therefore joins
  by declaring its own capabilities, and a workaround is widened only where the
  behavior was actually observed.
- **Xiaomi's MiMo-V2.6 series ships on every provider that lists it.** Xiaomi
  released `mimo-v2.6-pro`, `mimo-v2.6-flash`, and `mimo-v2.6-pro-ultraspeed`
  on 2026-09-22. All three are checked in on Xiaomi's own API, Command Code,
  the Nous Portal, and OpenRouter; opencode Go carries the Pro and Flash ids
  its catalog lists. Xiaomi publishes reasoning as a toggle rather than an
  effort ladder, so each entry keeps the single `high` rung every other MiMo
  route uses. The 1,048,576-token window is each provider's own published
  figure and compacts at 900,000, which still reserves the full 131,072-token
  output limit; the two opencode Go routes keep the 1,000,000 their V2.5
  siblings use, because OpenCode publishes no limit for a paid Go id.
  UltraSpeed is the same Pro answers generated faster at ten times the token
  price, and its picker description says so. `mimo-v2.6-flash-free` is
  curatable on the anonymous OpenCode routes; like `mimo-v2.5-free` it keeps
  conservative metadata, because its published 200,000-token window cannot
  reserve room for its own 32,000-token output limit.
- **StepFun ships as a first-party provider, one per regional platform.**
  `stepfun-api` is the global Open Platform (`https://api.stepfun.ai/v1`,
  `STEPFUN_API_KEY`) and `stepfun-api-cn` is the mainland console
  (`https://api.stepfun.com/v1`, `STEPFUN_API_CN_KEY`). Each console issues its
  own key, so they are credentialed and enabled separately and carry a
  `planNote` saying where to create the China one. Both serve
  `step-5-preview` (1M context, text + image), `step-3.7-flash` (256K, text +
  image) and the agent-tuned `step-3.5-flash-2603` (256K, text-only) over the
  standard `/chat/completions` surface with a top-level `reasoning_effort` —
  low/medium/high for the first two, low/high for the 2603 snapshot, all taken
  from StepFun's published model pages. The million-token route compacts at
  900,000 like every other one. The provider ids carry the `-api` suffix that
  `kimi-api` and `zai-api` already use, which also leaves the unreserved
  `stepfun` id available to operator-defined generic endpoints.
- **The Union Alpha routes are removed; both providers withdrew the preview.**
  OpenRouter's public model list no longer carries `stealth/union-alpha`, and
  OpenCode's models.dev record no longer carries `union-alpha` on Go, so the
  two checked-in routes pointed at ids that no longer resolve. Both configs,
  the Messages completion clamp that existed only for that hop, and the
  catalog/curation entries are gone. The OpenCode limits the preview exposed
  are provider-wide, not route-specific, so they stay: Console Go's
  2,500,000-character single-message rejection still replaces an oversized
  ImageGen data URL with a labeled stub (now in `opencode-message-compat.mjs`),
  compact overflow still hops to a larger same-family window without a
  cooldown, and a context-length 400 is still translated rather than
  classified as quota. Ox Alpha is untouched: it graduated to GLM-5.3-Flash
  earlier, and its slug aliases still keep an existing pin routable.
- **Z.ai Coding GLM agents now use a leaner execution overlay and stop treating a poll timeout as a stalled child.**
  The GPT-5.6-Sol behavior template already supplies routine progress cadence,
  parallel tool use, persistence after tool calls, and outcome-first handoff, so
  repeating those rules in `efficient-agentic` spent prompt budget without
  changing the contract. The Coding Plan GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-Flash routes now
  use `efficient-agentic-v2`, which keeps bounded tool output, secret-safe
  diagnostics, schema-first fixtures, RED-to-GREEN continuity, hypothesis
  retracing, and Windows quoting while adding one collaboration invariant:
  `wait_agent` timing out means only that the child has not finished yet. A
  running child is not interrupted or replaced for the same mutable task
  without a terminal error, explicit cancellation/supersession, safety reason,
  or repeated concrete no-progress evidence. The legacy overlay remains
  available for routes that already name it.
- **Your own OpenAI-compatible endpoints can be added from Control Center.**
  A generic provider already carried everything an operator needs — an address,
  a protected key file, `/models` discovery, curation into the picker, and
  `<provider>/<model>` slugs that cannot collide — but it existed only on the
  command line, and `providerOnboardingSnapshot()` walked the checked-in
  registry alone, so nothing in the desktop app could see one. **Models →
  Custom → Add endpoint** now takes a name, a base URL, a Chat Completions or
  Responses choice, and a key, and the endpoint's own chip owns the rest: add
  models from its catalog, add one **By name** for a private or preview id that
  catalog never lists, remove a model, edit the address or key, or remove the
  endpoint with its key and models. The key crosses from the renderer on
  standard input (`providers generic credential ID set --stdin`), because the
  existing hidden prompt opens `/dev/tty` and an Electron child has none.
  Endpoints ride in their own `customEndpoints` array rather than among
  `providers`, so the tray and guided setup cannot mistake one for a
  checked-in provider they may select.
- **Adding a custom endpoint no longer fails on the deadline check.**
  `generic-providers` republishes the overlay and restarts the router, exactly
  as `credential` does, but it was missing from control.mjs's restart-bearing
  set. It therefore ran under the 850-second budget while
  `assertRestartingPublicationAllowance` demands room for a full
  publication-plus-readiness epoch, and every add refused with "The
  model-overlay deadline cannot preserve publication and the full router
  readiness allowance" before writing anything.
- **A crashing router child no longer reports itself as a stack trace.**
  `safeFailure()` forwarded Node's whole uncaught-exception report, so a
  desktop error read `file:///…/model-overlay-publication.mjs:94 const error =
  new Error( ^ Error: …` with the sentence buried in the middle. It now keeps
  the message and drops the file, the source excerpt, the caret, and the
  frames; a child that failed without throwing is still shown whole, and
  redaction is unchanged.
- **A saved endpoint says at once whether it answers.** Adding or editing one
  runs a single `GET /models` against it, so an unreachable host, a typo, or a
  rejected key is named while the operator is still in the dialog, with the
  option to register a model by name anyway, instead of silently opening an
  empty model picker.
- **Publishing into a DeepSeek Harness settings file no longer nests the route
  inside somebody else's provider, and removing it no longer empties the
  file.** `dsh-config-manager.mjs` read "does this mapping hold anything but
  ours?" off `children`, which is only the keys the YAML lexer could register.
  A block sequence, a merge key, or a provider id the key grammar declines
  (`openrouter/free:`) lives inside the node while being invisible there. So
  publishing copied its indentation off a hoisted grandchild and wrote
  `codex-router:` two columns too deep -- inside the user's provider, where the
  harness never looks, while every status read agreed the publish had worked --
  and removal, seeing `children.size === 1`, spliced the whole `providers:`
  section away: a 143-byte settings file with somebody else's route in it came
  back empty. One comment line above our key was enough to do the same. The
  credentials document had the matching failure: `refs:` holding an entry the
  grammar declines left the indent falling back to `refs.indent + 2` while the
  entries on disk sat at four, and that mixed-indent block costs every
  adapter's key, not just ours. `routed-harness-document.mjs` already refused
  all of this; its `unaccountedLines` helper moves to `yaml-structure.mjs` and
  both managers now share it. Anything this reader cannot account for is
  refused with the file untouched and the offending line named.
- **The bundled `codex-router` skill no longer documents the subagent model
  pinning the router stopped doing.** An explicit `spawn_agent.model` is kept;
  only a call that omits the model inherits the routed parent. That shipped as
  a code change, a `.claude/skills/codex-subagents` rewrite and a
  `docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md` update, but `skills/codex-router/SKILL.md` -- the copy
  installed into every user's `~/.codex/skills` -- still told its reader that
  in-session subagents are always pinned to the parent, and so did the comment
  above `SPAWN_MODEL_TOOLS`. Both are corrected, and a source assertion now
  fails on the stale claim so the next drift is not silent.
- **An apostrophe in a harness config no longer moves the router's route into
  somebody else's value.** `yaml-structure.mjs` treated every `'` and `"` as a
  quoting indicator, but YAML only gives a quote that meaning where a node can
  begin: `note: don't edit` is a plain scalar, not an unterminated quoted one.
  A single apostrophe therefore swallowed the rest of the document. When
  nothing later matched it, the scan refused a perfectly ordinary file and the
  router could not publish at all; when a later line happened to carry a
  matching quote, the scan finished quietly having hidden every key in between,
  and the splice wrote `codex-router:` inside a block scalar or a list item.
  The harness then saw no route and the user's value grew four lines of YAML.
  A quote now opens a scalar only at the start of a value, after a flow
  collection's `[`, `{`, `,` or `:`, and after a block sequence's `- `. Across
  27,045 generated documents that PyYAML accepts, 6,956 refusals, 184
  unparseable outputs and 178 misplaced routes all go to zero. Affects
  DeepSeek Harness `settings.yaml` and `.credentials.yaml`, omp `models.yml`,
  Hermes Agent `config.yaml`, and caller-capability refreshes into all three.
- **The Devin CLI model list asks for the method Devin 3000.x actually serves.**
  `devin-cli` called `GetCascadeModelConfigs`, which is the IDE's method; the
  CLI moved to `GetCliModelConfigs`, so a CLI-credentialed account was answered
  Connect `invalid_argument` on every `bin/devin-probe` and `bin/curate-models
  devin-cli` run (#770). Both methods are still declared on the service, which
  is why the refusal did not arrive as `unimplemented`. Re-reading every field
  the router writes against Devin 3000.10.31 found the request shape unchanged,
  so the method name was the whole drift. The probe now says so when an
  `invalid_argument` lands behind a clean request-shape check, and the unused
  `MODEL_INFO` table -- whose field numbers had also gone stale -- is gone. The
  provider remains unverified: no maintainer has run a live turn.
- **`start` and `restart` say the scheduled task is missing instead of relaying
  schtasks.** On Windows both verbs went straight to
  `schtasks /Change /TN "Codex Router" /ENABLE`, so with no task registered the
  operator got schtasks.exe's own error, naming neither the task nor anything
  to do about it (#760). `stop` had guarded on the task's existence since it
  shipped; these two now do too, and name `service.mjs install` and
  `doctor --fix`. Nothing is mutated on the way out, and a `start` that cannot
  start no longer prints `{"state":"running"}`.
- **OpenCode Go Messages no longer 400s a generated ImageGen PNG.** Console
  Go rejects a single `messages[N].content` over 2,500,000 characters. A
  live Union Alpha follow-up after `image_gen` carried a 2.03 MiB
  1536×1024 PNG as a 2,707,238-character data URL and died before
  `final_answer`. The hop now replaces that oversized image with a labeled
  stub; Codex still has the file. Compact stays 180,000 and the completion
  cap stays 32,768.

- **Command Code's Gemini 3.8 Flash accepts nullable tool parameters.** Convert
  a single concrete type plus `null` to an explicit union before forwarding,
  preserving array constraints and nested schemas. This prevents the observed
  `any_of` sibling-field rejection for Codex's image-generation tool, including
  definitions restored from tool-search history. Other routes keep their schemas.

- **Union Alpha publishes the measured 32,768 completion reserve.** OpenCode
  and Console Go treat an omitted `max_tokens` as the advertised 131,072
  output. A Desktop-sized first turn (~140k rendered) plus that reserve
  exceeds the 262,144 window and comes back as
  `context_length_exceeded` / "tokenizer/template mismatch, not high demand"
  even though the hop would have fitted the same prompt at 32,768. The
  Messages route now always sends 32,768 and the catalog / OpenCode
  `limit.output` advertise that cap. Compact stays 180,000. Rebuild the
  catalog; a thread already past OpenCode's tokenizer still needs a new
  task.

- **An unfinished Union Alpha prefix closed as `output_text` is still truncated.**
  The 14:12 ImageGen retry stored `I'll use the image generation` as
  `final_answer` after empty-completion already withheld the first attempt.
  LiteLLM had closed that fragment as a real `output_text` part, so the
  thinking-match withhold never fired. A held done snapshot that is still a
  mid-clause cut is withheld; punctuated answers stay answers.
- **Automatic approval reviews can fall back to a routed model when ChatGPT
  quota runs out.** Codex runs `Approve for me` on its own hidden native model,
  so with `Use Router with ChatGPT` on, an exhausted plan left a routed session
  proposing commands it could not execute (#787).
  `./bin/control auto-review-fallback set <provider/model>` names a reviewer for
  exactly those turns. It engages only after the native reviewer has itself
  refused for quota, and only for the window that refusal named -- a denial, a
  policy rejection, a 5xx, and anything ambiguous all stay native, and a `deny`
  is never retried through another model. The first native answer afterwards
  ends the window. The main agent's model is unaffected either way.
- **`subagents explain <model>` says why a route cannot be delegated to.** The
  answer lived in three places that never met -- selection in `subagents
  status`, promotion in the published catalog, and the agent definition on disk
  -- so the only way to find out was to spawn one and read `codex exited 1`
  (#804). The new command names the first blocker and the command that fixes
  it, distinguishes a typo from an uncurated model from a native slug, and says
  whether a route's v2 claim comes from the registry, a local five-check run, or
  the operator's own selection. Read-only and quota-free.

- **A configured subagent effort no longer reads as a drifted agent
  definition.** `syncRoutedCodexAgents` wrote `model_reasoning_effort` into the
  definition and `routedCodexAgentStatus` computed the expected contents without
  it, so every model with a subagent effort set was reported `stale` forever:
  doctor flagged drift, `--fix` republished identical bytes, and the next check
  flagged it again.

- **Playwright is 1.63.0 in both the router tests and the Control Center.**
  Dependabot #758 only bumped the root pin. The Control Center lock stays in
  step so renderer tests and docs screenshots use the same browser.
- **LiteLLM's finish sequence no longer stores a leaked Union Alpha prefix.**
  Holding until `output_text.done` assumed that event arrived after the
  `reasoning_text` close. LiteLLM 1.96 emits the done snapshot first, then
  closes the part as thinking, which stored
  `The skill is loaded. This is a single concept-sheet generation: a
  GTA-style AAA` as `final_answer`. The done snapshot is held until that
  close; the same text (or a prefix of the thinking) is withheld so
  empty-completion can retry. A distinct answer still completes.

- **A truncated `exec_command` JSON call is retried instead of a 502.** Union
  Alpha can finish a tool call with an unterminated string. The router still
  refuses to store that item, but if Codex has not seen a byte yet it retries
  once like an empty completion instead of answering `unexpected status 502`.

- **A leaked Union Alpha prefix is still truncated when LiteLLM also sends
  `output_text.done`.** Holding until that event was not enough: the live
  ImageGen turnaround closed as `reasoning_text` and then `output_text.done`
  for the same 29-token sentence ending `(no reference`. The snapshot is
  withheld so empty-completion can retry instead of storing it as
  `final_answer`.

- **Union Alpha no longer compact-loops on a Codex Desktop tool list.** Compact
  at 80,000 sat below ~88–108k of cached tool-schema tokens, so every ImageGen
  skill read compacted, the checkpoint kept a 1k excerpt, and the model
  re-read the file. Compact is 180,000, above that floor. The 32,768
  `max_tokens` cap and compact overflow hop stay. Rebuild the catalog and
  start a new Codex task; a thread already in the compact loop will keep
  looping.

- **Union Alpha no longer stores a 21-token mid-sentence `final_answer` after a
  premature `reasoning_text` close.** The earlier drop only fired when a
  reasoning-summary delta had already opened the repair. Live ImageGen turns
  streamed `I'll use the ImageGen skill… so` with no summary first, so the
  close still ended the message and Codex marked the turn complete. The repair
  now holds that prefix until `output_text.done`; if the stream completes
  without it, empty-completion retries or fails instead of succeeding with 21
  tokens.

- **Compact overflow on Union Alpha can retry a larger-window model.** OpenCode
  estimated about 434,983 tokens against Union Alpha's 262,144 card, so
  compacting the same 262k route cannot save that thread. Compact failures
  are translated to `context_length_exceeded` instead of LiteLLM's model-group
  wrapper. Compact may retry a larger-window model, including a same-family
  OpenCode Go 1M route, without recording a cooldown. Ordinary turns still
  never swap on HTTP 400. If every configured window is still too small, start
  a new Codex task.

- **Union Alpha on OpenCode Go Messages caps the Messages completion budget.**
  Console Go 400s a prompt-plus-completion that does not fit every available
  backend. The Go Messages route keeps the advertised 262,144 window, caps
  Messages `max_tokens` at 32,768, and translates that 400 as a context-window
  error rather than a generic rejection. The shipped slug is
  `opencode-go-messages/union-alpha`.

- **Union Alpha is now a checked-in OpenRouter route.** OpenRouter publishes
  this stealth preview as `stealth/union-alpha` (262,144 context, 131,072
  output, text and image input, currently free). The shipped slug is
  `openrouter/union-alpha`. OpenRouter does not advertise a reasoning-effort
  ladder, so the stored rung is the conservative single `high`. Its endpoint
  record accepts `tool_choice` auto only (`required` and `none` are false), so
  the route uses `auto-tool-choice`. Cline the IDE can already pick this id
  through OpenRouter; ClinePass and Command Code do not list it. Rebuild the
  catalog and fully quit and reopen Codex.

- **A completed function_call with invalid JSON arguments is no longer stored.**
  Relaying that item left Codex unable to execute it and poisoned every later
  turn on the thread (#797). The router now withholds the completing snapshot
  and fails the turn instead of inventing a closing quote. Empty arguments,
  custom tools, and native-hook raw patches are unchanged.

- **A local tool-argument conversion failure is no longer a provider rejection.**
  LiteLLM raises that parse while building Anthropic `tool_use.input` from
  stored history, before any provider request. The error now names the stored
  call and does not fail over, even when the argument body matches a quota
  phrase (#796).

- **OpenCode Go Messages no longer 400s Codex hosted/custom leftovers or 502s
  thinking-only streams.** Anthropic Messages (Union Alpha and every other
  `protocol: "anthropic"` route) now keeps only named functions with object
  schemas, and LiteLLM's Chat Completions reasoning-summary repair attaches to
  those routes because they still set `use_chat_completions_api: true`. A
  `reasoning_text` close is thinking, not an answer, so the empty-completion
  guard can still retry; a `reasoning_text` close that arrives before
  `output_text.done` also no longer ends the visible message, which had
  truncated Union Alpha replies mid-sentence (`Union Alpha (`). Qwen on this
  route additionally omits `tool_choice` entirely (`omit-tool-choice`); MiniMax
  still accepts the field. Rebuild the catalog and fully quit and reopen Codex.
  Union Alpha is `opencode-go-messages/union-alpha`.

- **OpenCode Zen now has Messages and Responses protocol variants.** Claude
  curated under `opencode-zen` lands on `opencode-zen-messages`; GPT, Grok, and
  Muse land on `opencode-zen-responses`; Gemini is refused. The variants share
  Go's key and selection toggle but keep Zen's separately billed cooldown
  scope. Re-curate with `bin/curate-models opencode-zen` to move existing Chat
  entries onto the matching wire.

- **Google Cloud Vertex AI is a catalog-only provider.** It authenticates with
  Application Default Credentials from `gcloud auth application-default login`
  (never a stored API key or a silent `gcloud auth login` user token), honors
  `--no-discovery`, and lists Model Garden models for `bin/curate-models vertex`.
  A discovered id is not routable until it is curated onto a reviewed adapter.

- **Direct Meta Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor no longer fails on recursive Codex tool
  schemas.** Meta's direct Responses endpoint answers a self-referencing tool
  schema with HTTP 400 `Recursive JSON schemas are not currently supported`
  before inference, losing the whole turn downstream of the gateway. The
  verified `meta/muse-spark-1.3-contributor` route now breaks only the
  cycle-closing reference edge through the existing `toolSchemaRecursion:
  "flatten"` repair, preserving definitions, acyclic references, and sibling
  constraints. Sibling Meta routes keep their payloads until their own endpoint
  proves the same restriction (#792).
- **Union Alpha is now a checked-in OpenCode Go route.** OpenCode's live Go
  catalog and docs publish this stealth model as `union-alpha` on the Messages
  API (`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages`), currently free for a limited
  time. The shipped slug is `opencode-go-messages/union-alpha`. Window (262,144)
  and output (131,072) come from OpenCode's models.dev record; Codex compact
  reserves that output budget. OpenCode documents reasoning but publishes an
  empty effort list, so the stored ladder is the conservative single `high`.
  The maker is unnamed, so the Control Center uses the stealth mark rather than
  guessing a vendor. Omen Alpha is still in the live catalog but deprecated in
  that same record and is not checked in. Rebuild the catalog and fully quit
  and reopen Codex to see the new picker row.

- **A `.env` that mixes CRLF and LF keeps both.** The Gemini integration owns a
  marker-delimited block in `$GEMINI_HOME/.env` and treats every other byte as
  the user's, but it detected one line ending for the whole document and
  rejoined every line on it. A file touched by two editors came back with the
  router's ending on lines the router never wrote -- and came back that way
  again after the block was removed, so the rewrite outlived the integration.
  Each line now keeps the terminator it arrived with, and the block is rendered
  with the document's prevailing one. A file that ends without a newline still
  gains exactly one, because the block has to start on its own line; that is the
  only difference a publish and removal now leaves behind.
- **Command Code's DeepSeek V4.1 Flash route advertises image input.** The
  checked-in entry was text-only until Command Code documented the capability
  at the Provider API: the model page lists Image input, and the Provider FAQ
  says message content is text and images with no per-model pre-gate. Matching
  the other V4.1 Flash routes, `commandcode/deepseek-v4.1-flash` now declares
  `["text", "image"]` so pasted screenshots go to the model instead of the
  vision bridge (#783). Rebuild the catalog and fully quit and reopen Codex
  before pasting an image.

- **Doctor no longer fails "Enabled providers: none" for a generic-only
  install.** Registry selection and generic providers are two lists: an empty
  `enabled-providers.json` with a credentialed Poe (or other generic) route
  still serves traffic, but doctor only named the registry file and exited 1
  while the generic row said OK (#774). Enabled generics now count.

- **ainetcafe added as an API-key provider.** `ainetcafe/kimi-k3` routes to
  ainetcafe's OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`https://microquickjs.com/v1`,
  key `AINETCAFE_API_KEY`), which serves Kimi K3 from its own cluster. It
  reuses the `kimi-k3` request profile (top-level `reasoning_effort`, no
  `thinking`), declares the default 256K context and text + image input, and
  stays conservative on original-detail images like the other K3 relays.

- **The Windows Control Center no longer flashes a console on every refresh.**
  Ordinary `control.mjs` invocations re-exec through the process tree with
  `stdio: "inherit"`, which is required so credential stdin and live output
  survive. That used to map every inherit to `windowsHide: false`, so a parent
  with no console of its own — the packaged Electron tray — made Windows
  allocate a new visible Windows Terminal on every snapshot (#775, #731).
  Process-tree now treats inherit without a TTY as background work: three
  fresh pipes, live stdin/stdout/stderr relay, and `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (#744).
  A real terminal still inherits a console. Switching the re-exec to
  `capture` would hide the window the wrong way: capture ignores stdin, which
  is how Control Center writes provider keys.

- **Muse Spark 1.3 Free no longer 400s on follow-up turns.** OpenCode Zen's
  anonymous Responses route is a Console proxy, so Meta-issued reasoning
  `encrypted_content` is bound to Console's caller, not this router. Replaying
  it came back as HTTP 400 "reasoning `encrypted_content` was not issued to this
  caller". The exact Muse Contributor Free Responses gate now drops that
  continuation token (keeping any summary text) and stops asking for it on
  `include`. Paid Zen/Go keep a stable key and are unchanged.

- **DashScope's documented thinking ladder now reaches the model, so a curated
  DashScope route can offer more than one rung.** Model Studio documents
  `reasoning.effort` with a ladder per upstream family, but the router had no
  profile on a generic provider's boundary: the nested `reasoning.effort` Codex
  sends is ignored by `/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions`, which reads the
  flat `reasoning_effort`, so every rung produced the same turn and curation
  could only publish the conservative single `high`. The new curatable
  `dashscope-reasoning` profile folds the requested rung onto the family's
  documented ladder (Qwen3.8 `none`/`low`/`medium`/`xhigh`, GLM-5.3
  `low`/`high`/`max`, DeepSeek V4.x `none`/`high`/`max`, with the dated
  `0731`/`0813` snapshots keeping `low`), writes whichever
  spelling the surface reads, maps Codex's `minimal` onto DashScope's `none`
  because Codex ships no thinking-off rung, and downgrades the forced
  `tool_choice` the Qwen3.8 family refuses in thinking mode. Measured end to
  end through the router: `minimal` returns zero reasoning tokens on Qwen3.8
  and DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, and `bin/test-model --live --yes` passes 5/5 on all
  five curated DashScope models (#785).

- **OpenCode Go no longer 400s a follow-up after `apply_patch`.** The
  custom→function bridge rewrote `custom_tool_call_output` to
  `function_call_output` and kept the item `id` (`ctco_…`). Console Go
  requires function-shaped ids to begin with `fc`, so the next turn failed
  with that id at the same index and stayed broken for the rest of the
  thread (#780). The bridge now omits a non-`fc` string `id` on the rewritten
  call and output; `call_id` still pairs them. A native-minted `fc…` id is
  kept.

- **A multiline string in `config.toml` is no longer edited as if it were
  settings.** The root-level helpers found assignments by matching lines, so a
  line inside a multiline string -- prose in `instructions`, a documented
  example -- counted as one whenever it was shaped like `model = ...`. Because
  it came first, it was the line that got rewritten, deleted when a value
  moved, and read back as the current setting. Switching the model edited the
  user's prose and left the real `model` untouched; enabling the router deleted
  a line out of the middle of their text; and the router journalled the prose
  as the previous value, so turning it off restored that. All of it silent, and
  the setting the user asked for never changed. These helpers now locate the
  assignment through `scanTomlDocument` -- the fail-closed structural lexer this
  file already uses for table boundaries, which exists to tell a real
  assignment from text that looks like one. String values are decoded by the
  lexer, including trailing comments. Root reads and writes scan the same root
  section, even when a later table contains an invalid escape. Catalog removal,
  concurrency detection, and managed-marker insertion also respect structure.
  Multiline root settings are refused rather than partially removed, and
  login-free in-place changes retain strict whole-document validation.
  Legacy malformed root sections retain their best-effort line matching so
  Windows prototype installations can still be disabled; prose preservation
  is only guaranteed when that root section can be scanned.
- **Routed models can be published ahead of the native GPT picker entries.**
  Codex renders its picker by `priority`, and routed models always landed in a
  band after the highest visible native entry, so an operator whose everyday
  models are external could not put them first. `model-picker.json` now
  carries an `order` (`native-first`, the unchanged default, or
  `routed-first`), set with `./bin/model-router codex picker-order`. Under
  `routed-first` every routed model -- certified v2 spawn routes included, so
  none interleaves with the shifted natives -- publishes at 1..N in the
  existing vendor-group order and the natives move after them. Visibility
  writers preserve the choice; an older file or an unrecognized value keeps
  the default.
- **Generic Ollama providers are curated at the model's served context length
  and modalities instead of the conservative default.** Ollama's
  OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` lists ids only, so a curated Ollama model
  carried the 131072-token guess (#266) and text-only input even when the
  server runs it at 1M with vision. Generic discovery now asks the same origin's
  `/api/show` for each listed model when the provider is an OpenAI-chat
  endpoint rooted at `/v1`, proves the answer is Ollama-shaped, and fills in
  only the fields the list left blank. The probe is bounded like the catalog
  fetch, stops on a missing route or after three leading refusals, and skips a
  model the server cannot describe. Curation stores the advertised window and
  image input; discovery reports them as `contextLengths` and the new
  `inputModalities` map, so a documented or default modality never masquerades
  as a served one.
- **GLM-5.3-Flash on Command Code no longer sends an effort rung the model
  refuses by name.** `commandcode/glm-5.3-flash` declares the model's
  `low`/`high`/`max` ladder and carried no `requestProfile`, and the profile
  chain in `src/api-forwarder.mjs` is keyed entirely on that field — so the
  effort Codex sent went upstream verbatim. Codex older than 0.143 has no `max`
  in its effort enum, so `clampModelEfforts` rewrites this route's default down
  to `xhigh`, which is the rung GLM-5.3-Flash answers with `400 — [1210] This
  model always engages in thinking and cannot be disabled; please use low,
  high, or max`. The route now carries the same `ox-alpha` clamp the OpenCode Go
  and OpenRouter Flash routes use, so `xhigh`/`ultra` land on `max` and
  `medium`/`minimal` on `low`, an absent effort stays absent, and no rung the
  entry does not advertise can leave the router. This asserts nothing about
  Command Code's own validation, which the provider does not document; the plan
  fallback at `/alpha/generate` carries no effort at all and is unchanged.
  `compHash` is bumped, so rebuild the catalog and fully quit and reopen Codex.

- **GLM-5.3-Flash on Command Code now compacts at 400K like every other route
  for that model.** `commandcode/glm-5.3-flash` shipped with
  `autoCompact: 900000` — the Command Code house value for a 1M window, carried
  by two dozen of that provider's entries — while the five other checked-in
  GLM-5.3-Flash routes compact at 400,000. That threshold is a property of the
  model: large live multimodal Flash histories repeatedly returned empty
  completions before the advertised limit, which is why
  `nousresearch/glm-5.3-flash` was dropped rather than shipped at 943K. The
  Command Code entry was written fresh in a bulk catalog pin and took the
  provider default; no commit message, comment, or research note argued for
  900K, and the earlier incarnation of the same file carried 400,000. Codex
  therefore ran this route 500,000 tokens past the point where the model has
  been seen to go blank. The route is also now named in the
  `test/glm-5.3-flash.test.mjs` inventory — its absence there is what let the
  outlier live — and that inventory is now derived from the registry, so the
  next Flash route cannot be omitted silently. `compHash` is bumped, so rebuild
  the catalog and fully quit and reopen Codex to pick up the new threshold.
- **A failed script install no longer leaves POSIX users stuck on the rollback
  revision.** After setup fails, the checkout is detached at the previous
  commit by design so the service is not left on half-applied code. Windows
  and `./bin/update` already switched that state back to `main` before the
  next fetch; `install.sh` refused instead because it was not on `main`. A
  Homebrew user who then installed from the script could stay on
  `refs/codex-router/rollback` and keep serving the tree that predates
  `x-opencode-session` (#761). A retry now restores `main` the same way.

## 0.6.0

- **Thinking models on Chat resellers outside the native-reasoning contract no
  longer see their own past reasoning replayed as visible prose.** #708 widened
  the reasoning-lifecycle repair from `grok-oauth` to every `openai`-protocol
  provider, which is what finally let reasoning reach Codex on these routes —
  and as a side effect made Codex store a reasoning item for those turns. Most
  Command Code thinking models match no entry in the native-reasoning family
  table (`commandcode/qwen3.8-flash` resolves to upstream `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash`),
  and for those the carry turned the stored reasoning into `output_text` on the
  next turn. A model that reads its own thinking as prose it once said moves new
  thinking into the answer channel and loops on its last progress note — the
  documented 2, 4, 5, 8, 16 copies per message (#755). Those routes now drop the
  reasoning from the carry instead of converting it, which asserts nothing about
  any vendor's `reasoning_content` handling; routes inside the contract still
  carry theirs as `thinking` parts, and native Responses providers are
  untouched. Before #708 this was inert on these routes, because no reasoning
  item was stored to carry.
- **A slow first start no longer uninstalls the service the installer just
  installed.** On a clean machine the install wrote its launchers and registered
  its service correctly, then a cold-starting LiteLLM gateway with a large model
  set overran the 300-second health wait. The installer treated that as a failed
  install and rolled back — `service.mjs uninstall` deletes the service *and*
  unlinks both launchers — so the operator was left with `"installed":true` in
  the log, no `start-codex-router.cmd` on disk, no scheduled task, and a bare
  `fetch failed` naming nothing (#760). The earlier guard for this only covered
  a reinstall over an already-working router; a first install had no prior state
  to compare against and was torn out anyway. `service.mjs` now exits **75**
  (`EX_TEMPFAIL`) when the service is installed and running but health has not
  answered yet, and both installers leave the service and the client config
  exactly as installed for that case, printing what to check instead. A crash
  loop or a dead launcher is still a rollback: those are broken rather than
  slow, and the readiness layer tags only the retryable timeout.

- **GLM-5.3-Flash reads pasted images itself on Z.ai and OpenRouter instead of
  paying another model to describe them.** `zai-coding/glm-5.3-flash`,
  `zai-api/glm-5.3-flash`, and `openrouter/glm-5.3-flash` declared
  `inputModalities: ["text"]`, so `bridgeVisionInput` sent every image in the
  turn to a vision engine and substituted a transcript — spending a second
  provider's quota, and losing whatever a transcript cannot carry — for a model
  Z.ai documents as natively multimodal (#756). Z.ai gives the model's input
  modality as `Video / Image / Text / File`, documents its `image_url` content
  block, and says it is fully available on the GLM Coding Plan; OpenRouter's own
  catalog publishes `["text","image","video"]` for `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`. All
  three entries now declare `["text", "image"]`. The text-only values were never
  a measurement: each entry was written fresh when the withdrawn Ox Alpha preset
  was removed and took the conservative default, while the preset it replaced
  had carried image input from three provider catalogs. The full-size GLM-5.3
  routes stay text-only, which is the same fact rather than an inconsistency —
  Flash is the multimodal member of that family — and a test now holds both
  halves. `compHash` is bumped on each changed entry, so rebuild the catalog and
  fully quit and reopen Codex before pasting an image.

- **Hy4's nonce-suffixed reasoning delimiters no longer leak the model's
  planning into the answer.** Hy4 Preview writes its own markup with a
  per-message nonce (`</think:6124c78e>`, the family
  `src/leaked-tool-call-recovery.mjs` already parses tool calls out of). A
  serving stack that consumes the opening tag but relays the close left the
  model's internal prose in `output_text` with only an orphan close behind it,
  and the reasoning-tag stripper's exact `</think>` grammar could not see it, so
  the chain-of-thought was shown as the answer and replayed into later turns
  (#654, `commandcode/hy4-preview`). The stripper now reads the suffix, and an
  orphan nonce close -- one whose opening tag never appeared -- ends the leaked
  reasoning and takes the text in front of it. Both are gated to Hy4 routes by
  the same `usesHy4NonceMarkup` check the tool-call recovery uses: a bare
  `</think>` keeps its prefix everywhere, since that spelling can appear in an
  answer about reasoning tags. Tool-call markup spans are still relayed
  verbatim; only an orphan close of one is read as a terminator. Bytes the
  delta channel has already emitted cannot be retracted, so a leak split across
  deltas can still flash on screen; `output_text.done` and the stored message
  item -- what is replayed into the next turn -- are cleaned either way.
- **Native replay no longer sends both a full reasoning item and its duplicate
  reference.** A request can contain an inline `reasoning` item followed by an
  `item_reference` with the same `rs_` id. Native input normalization now keeps
  the full item and removes only that redundant reference after all existing
  reasoning cleanup has run. A null, empty, or non-string `encrypted_content`
  value is not treated as evidence that the item was never stored: direct-
  credential callers retain the existing stored-namespace fallback, and a bare
  reference with no surviving inline item remains untouched.

- **Locally curated Moonshot models with `toolSchemaRecursion: "flatten"`
  preserve recoverable types when breaking recursive tool references.** No
  shipped Kimi model enables flattening; stock Kimi and Meta payloads are
  unchanged. Explicit types and type-implying siblings take precedence over
  the referenced definition. Pure reference aliases are followed safely.
  Untyped recursive unions and reference-only rings still cannot supply a
  target type and remain permissive; this is not a general fix for Moonshot's
  `missing type in anyOf properties` error. The route behind #726 has not been
  established, so that issue is not claimed resolved by this change.

- **A resold image cannot be charged as prose in the prompt-token estimate.**
  `maxImageTokensForRoute` bounded only the three documented direct DeepSeek
  Flash models, so a route such as `openrouter/deepseek-v4.1-flash` had no bound
  at all and the estimator added the image's base64 to the prompt tokens — 819k
  tokens for one 2.7 MB screenshot, which is most of a 1M window and enough to
  trigger client auto-compaction on its own. Routes without a documented bound
  now take a conservative 4096-token default; the three DeepSeek Flash models
  keep their documented 1024.
- **Routed coding clients can be kept current from the Harness page.**
  `control client-update <id>` and `control client-update --all`, plus an
  **Update** button on each row and **Update all** in the header, move
  opencode, pi, Command Code, and Hermes Agent to their latest release. Each
  runs that client's own updater (`opencode upgrade`, `pi update --self`,
  `command-code update`, `hermes update --yes`) rather than `npm install -g`,
  so a CLI installed by Homebrew or a `curl | sh` script is updated in place
  instead of gaining a second npm copy that may win or lose on PATH. omp ships
  neither a package this router installs nor a self-update subcommand, so its
  row prints the project's own three installs. Updating stays a separate,
  explicit action: publishing a model list never changes a client's version.
  `--all` skips clients that are not installed and reports each one instead of
  stopping at the first failure.
- **pi is installed from its maintained package.** The pi coding agent moved
  from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` (last published at 0.73.1) to
  `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Setup installed the abandoned name, which
  still installs and still answers `pi --version`, so the stale agent looked
  healthy. pi's own `--ignore-scripts` install flag is used as well.
- **Muse Spark Responses turns no longer end in a gateway error.** OpenCode Go
  and Zen send `event: ping` (`{"type":"ping","cost":"0"}`) after every
  `response.completed`. The API forwarder treated it as data after the terminal
  event and appended `invalid_responses_stream`, which LiteLLM re-raised as
  `Response API in-stream error` on every completed `opencode-go-responses` and
  `opencode-free-responses` turn. Codex ignores bytes after a terminal event, so
  it went unnoticed; opencode and pi validate them and failed every turn. A
  keep-alive or SSE comment after the terminal event is now dropped; real data
  after it is still refused.
- **Thinking models behind resellers now get their reasoning replayed the way
  their vendors require.** The replay contract was keyed on request profiles,
  so `zai-coding/glm-5.3` replayed reasoning as `reasoning_content` while the
  same GLM on opencode Go, OpenRouter, or Command Code -- and Kimi K3, Hy3,
  MiniMax M3, DeepSeek there -- had it replayed as visible assistant text, the
  shape that made Hy4 loop on its own progress notes. The contract is now
  keyed on the upstream model family for Chat Completions resellers: DeepSeek
  (the API 400s without it), GLM-5.x (Z.ai requires the history replayed with
  preserved thinking), Kimi K3 (Moonshot requires it in tool loops), MiniMax
  M3 (interleaved thinking), and Tencent Hy3/Hy4. Verified live on every
  reachable route on opencode Go, OpenRouter, and Command Code; Anthropic
  protocol variants and resellers that were not probed keep their existing
  channel.
- **Hy4 Preview no longer loops on its own progress notes mid-turn.** Its
  reasoning is now replayed to it the way DeepSeek's and GLM's already were --
  as `reasoning_content` on the assistant turn that produced it -- instead of
  as visible assistant text. Replayed as prose, the model read its own past
  thinking as something it had said aloud, moved new thinking into the answer
  channel (reasoning tokens went from 174 to 0 in one step), and from there
  repeated its last note 2, 4, 5, 8, then 16 times per message while Codex
  showed "Reconnecting". Applies to every route on the `hy4-reasoning` profile
  (opencode Go, OpenRouter, NanoGPT, Nous); Command Code's own Hy4 shim and
  Cline are unchanged.
- **A routed turn no longer dies silently when the model writes its tool calls
  as text.** Tencent Hy4 Preview has a tool-call syntax of its own
  (`<tool_calls:NONCE>...`). When a serving stack fails to parse it, the calls
  arrive as ordinary text on the reasoning channel, nothing reaches the
  `tool_calls` array, and the turn ends on an assistant message with no content
  and no `function_call`. Codex reads that as the end of the turn and writes
  `task_complete` with `last_agent_message: null`, so the user is left with the
  "Worked for ..." group and no answer at all -- in the capture this was found
  in, four minutes of work vanished mid-investigation. The router now parses the
  leaked markup back into real `function_call` items, strips it from the text it
  was buried in, and emits the calls before the turn closes, so the model's own
  work continues. Only the model's calls are recovered: a malformed, unterminated
  or nonce-mismatched span is relayed verbatim, a stream without the markup is
  passed through byte-for-byte, and native turns gain no stage.
- **Reasoning from Chat Completions models now shows in Codex.** LiteLLM's
  Chat Completions to Responses bridge opens the assistant message first and
  streams the model's reasoning under a fresh hashed item id per delta, with no
  reasoning item around it. Codex drops deltas that belong to no open item, so
  routed models such as Hy4 Preview (Command Code), DeepSeek V4.1 Flash on
  opencode Go, and every other Chat Completions route showed no reasoning at
  all, and none was saved to the thread. The repair that already rebuilt one
  reasoning item for Grok OAuth now runs for every Chat Completions route.
  Direct DeepSeek keeps its own bridge repair, Responses and Messages providers
  are untouched, canonical streams pass byte-identical, and the Grok-specific
  gateway-error wording stays on Grok OAuth. Its first-frame bound also rises
  from 256 KiB to 10 MiB: LiteLLM echoes the whole Codex tool list in
  `response.created`, and in Codex Desktop that frame used to switch the repair
  off for the entire stream.
- **Blank tool-call messages and direct DeepSeek reasoning are repaired behind
  large tool lists.** LiteLLM echoes the request's instructions and whole tool
  list in `response.created` and `response.in_progress`. The stream repairs
  that remove LiteLLM's blank assistant message before a tool call (every Chat
  Completions and Messages route) and rebuild direct DeepSeek's reasoning item
  gave up on any frame over 256 KiB or with more than 8,192 JSON members, so a
  session whose tool list crossed either had both repairs switched off from
  its first event. Mock gateways send a bare envelope and never showed it. The
  frame bound now matches the namespace relay's 10 MiB, the JSON scan budgets
  grow with it, and malformed, ambiguous, or over-budget streams still pass
  through byte-identical.
- **Kimi no longer rejects a tool schema whose union leaf declares no type.**
  A nullable field written the ordinary way --
  `{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}` -- carries no `type` of its
  own, and Moonshot's validator refuses the whole request with HTTP 400
  `tools.function.parameters missing type in anyOf properties`, losing the turn
  on every Kimi model (#641). Nothing in the pipeline supplied one:
  `normalizeSchemaLiterals` only removes literals that contradict a type a node
  already declares. The Moonshot compatibility pass now declares a type where
  the node already implies one -- from `properties`/`required`, `items`, a
  single-typed `enum`/`const`, or a union whose branches all agree -- alongside
  the existing `$ref` inlining. A node that implies nothing (a bare `{}`, a
  lone `not`, a mixed `enum`) is left open, because narrowing a schema the
  client meant to leave open is worse than the rejection. Every other provider
  keeps the exact wire payload it has today.

- **A streamed answer no longer loses the whitespace it starts with.** The
  inline-reasoning stripper trimmed the leading whitespace of every message it
  streamed, but `stripThinkTags` -- the same module's whole-string form, used
  for the `output_text.done` snapshot and the stored message item -- trims only
  when it actually removed a tag, and returns an untagged message by identity.
  So an ordinary answer opening with a newline (a fenced code block, a leading
  blank line) reached the client without it, while the terminal snapshot beside
  it kept it: the rendered answer and the stored one disagreed on a route that
  had leaked no reasoning at all. A first delta made only of whitespace was
  dropped from the stream outright. The stripper now holds that whitespace until
  the first visible character, by which point it knows whether a tag was
  removed, and emits or drops it to match. The hold is bounded: nothing is kept
  once a tag has been removed, only the new delta is scanned rather than the
  accumulation, and past 8 KiB of unbroken whitespace the stripper emits what it
  holds instead of growing further. The observed leak shapes are unchanged --
  reasoning arrives before the answer, so the removal is always known in time.
- **opencode Zen's quota headers no longer overwrite the Go plan's.** Both
  plans share one credential and one selection toggle, but Zen bills at its own
  endpoint, which is why `cooldownScope` keeps Zen's identity where
  `canonicalProviderId` folds it into Go. The forwarder harvested the observed
  rate-limit headers under the canonical id instead, so every Zen response
  overwrote the Go plan's entry in `rate-limits.json` and every Go response
  overwrote Zen's -- one key holding whichever plan answered last, under the
  name of the other. Zen's window could not be read back either: every
  cooldown-scope consumer looks it up as `opencode-zen`, an id the file never
  held. The snapshot is now keyed by cooldown scope, the same identity the
  cooldown store beside it already uses, so the two cannot drift apart again
  (#575). Every other provider and variant keeps the key it has today, and a
  stale entry is replaced by the next response that carries headers.

- **A routed model the router has not loaded now fails locally, not at
  ChatGPT.** A model added to or renamed in `user-models.json` shows up in the
  Codex picker as soon as the catalog is rebuilt, but the running router reads
  its routes only at startup. Until the service restarted, the router forwarded
  that slug to ChatGPT like a native model, and the turn failed with "The
  'unorouter/gpt-6-astra' model is not supported when using Codex with a
  ChatGPT account". That read as an OpenAI restriction, and the prompt went to
  OpenAI besides. A user model the registry skipped as invalid failed the same
  way (#689). No native slug contains a `/`, so the router now answers a
  `provider/model` slug it has no route for with HTTP 400 `unrouted_model`
  before the native redirect or passthrough can take it. The message names the
  slug, says whether its provider is registered and enabled, gives the reason a
  user model with that slug was skipped, and says to restart with
  `bin/control service restart`. Native slugs, native aliases, the native
  redirect, and routed slugs behave as before. `doctor` now warns about each
  skipped user model that has no route.
- **Control Center loads Codex account usage again when both account reads
  answer.** The conflict resolution that merged #662 onto #648 renamed the
  shared normalizer to `partialUsage` but left the both-answered call site on
  the removed `usageFromReplies`, so every healthy poll threw a
  `ReferenceError` and Control Center painted "Some router data could not
  load" over the snapshot. The test fake answered synchronously from inside
  the probe's guarded stdin write, whose `catch` swallowed the error; it now
  has a `deferred` mode that answers on a later tick like a real pipe, and a
  both-answered test that fails without the fix.
- **Routed models' turns now render like native ones in Codex.** Native models
  label each assistant message `commentary` (a progress note before more tool
  calls) or `final_answer`, and Codex folds commentary into "Worked for ..."
  and shows the final answer below it. Routed providers never send the label,
  so every progress note rendered as a standalone answer. The router now labels
  routed messages from the stream's item order: a message a tool call or
  another message follows is commentary, and the last message of a completed
  response is the final answer, even when only reasoning follows it. A phase
  the provider sent always wins, text still streams live, and failed,
  incomplete, or unterminated responses are relayed unlabelled; a stream the
  upstream breaks off loses the held message frame along with the rest of the
  turn. The label costs no model tokens, but Codex sends it back on later
  turns. Chat-translated routes drop it from history. Responses-surface
  providers (Meta, OpenCode, OpenCode free, GitHub Copilot, DeepSeek Responses)
  receive it, as OpenAI's Responses schema allows. Endpoints added with
  `--adapter openai-responses` have it removed before the request leaves the
  router, since nothing shows that their validators accept it.
- **`apply_patch` calls no longer abort routed turns mid-stream when a model
  skips LiteLLM's wrapper.** LiteLLM sends native custom tools such as
  `apply_patch` to Chat Completions providers as a function with one `content`
  string, and relays whatever arguments come back. Models do not always comply:
  they put `content` after another key, answer `{"input": ...}` or `{}`, or send
  the raw patch. The router accepted only a leading `{"content": "..."}` and
  aborted the already-streaming response, and Codex retried the identical turn
  until it failed ("stream closed before response.completed"). The router log
  showed "invalid custom tool arguments done" or "incomplete custom tool
  argument delta sequence" on DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, DeepSeek V4 Flash, GLM-5.3,
  and Grok 4.5. The relay now derives the input exactly as LiteLLM does, so
  Codex receives the same call LiteLLM produced and a malformed patch comes
  back to the model as an ordinary tool error. A non-string `content`, a
  completed item that disagrees, and streamed text contradicted by the final
  input still fail closed. Reproduced offline against pinned LiteLLM 1.96.0.
- **Switching a conversation back to OpenAI no longer fails on routed item IDs.**
  Routed providers mint their own item IDs (`call_...`, `tool_...`,
  `chatcmpl-...`), Codex saves them, and OpenAI rejects them on replay with
  "Expected an ID that begins with 'fc'". Before sending saved history to
  OpenAI, the router now omits an optional `id` that lacks the native prefix for
  its item type: `fc` for function calls, `ctc` for custom tool calls such as
  `apply_patch`, and `msg` for messages. It preserves `call_id`, matching
  results, native IDs, and requests to external providers, so a native-only
  history is unchanged. Tests cover continuing and compacting a conversation,
  sessions supplied by the caller or the router, and replaying normalized
  history. Based on #664 by @webhype.

- **Tok/s counts reasoning tokens exactly when they were generated inside the
  timed window.** The Sep 5 change subtracted `reasoning_tokens` from the
  numerator on every route, but the first-token clock already started on the
  first reasoning delta, so on the OpenAI, Grok, and Command Code routes the
  reasoning time stayed in the denominator while its tokens left the
  numerator. A fit of generation time against visible and reasoning tokens
  over the local usage log put the cost of a reasoning token at roughly the
  cost of a visible one on those routes (gpt-5.6-sol 21 vs 25 ms, grok-4.6 18
  vs 16 ms), proving the thinking ran inside the window; the meter read
  gpt-5.6-luna at 21 tok/s against about 80 measured, and grok-4.5 at 16
  against about 67. Only Muse Spark on the OpenCode Responses route thinks in
  silence before its first token (0.02 ms per reasoning token in the same
  fit), which is the route the subtraction had been measured on. The stream
  transform now records `reasoningStreamed` -- whether any reasoning delta
  (Responses summary or text deltas, chat `reasoning_content` / `reasoning`)
  was relayed -- and reasoning deltas and chat tool-call deltas start the
  first-token clock like visible text does. `aggregateProviderUsage` and the
  Control Center per-event rate keep reasoning tokens when the marker is true
  or absent (rows written before it existed), and subtract them only when it
  is false. A reasoning count larger than the output count proves a provider
  reports visible tokens only (Command Code's DeepSeek V4 Pro: 62 of 146 rows,
  e.g. 150 output against 499 reasoning), so the inclusive total is rebuilt
  first instead of clamping the sample to zero and silently dropping it.
  Provider totals and billing are unchanged.
- **Meta API routes for Muse Spark 1.3 and its Contributor tier.**
  `meta/muse-spark-1.3` and `meta/muse-spark-1.3-contributor` mirror the Muse
  Spark 1.2 Meta routes: 1M context compacting at 900K, text and image input,
  the minimal-to-xhigh ladder defaulting to high, reasoning summaries, and
  `auto-tool-choice`. Meta's model page documents both ids, the window, and
  image input; the Contributor tier is cheaper because Meta may use its traffic
  to improve its products.
- **Command Code route for Muse Spark 1.3.** `commandcode/muse-spark-1.3`
  follows `commandcode/muse-spark-1.2`: 1M context compacting at 900K, text and
  image input, `auto-tool-choice`, and only the `high` effort, because Command
  Code does not document effort values. Command Code also lists the
  Contributor tier, but no Command Code Contributor route is checked in for
  either version; it remains available through `bin/curate-models commandcode`.
- **OpenRouter route for DeepSeek V4.1 Flash.**
  `openrouter/deepseek-v4.1-flash` takes OpenRouter's catalog values (1,048,576
  context, text and image input, low/high/max) and compacts at 900K to keep
  DeepSeek's 128K max-effort completion. It carries `auto-tool-choice` because
  DeepSeek rejects forced tool choices in thinking mode. Live verification has
  not been run; see `docs/research/deepseek-v4-1-flash-2026-09-11.md`.
- **Preserve tool calls after large fragmented response preludes.** Allow one
  unfinished initial event within the existing 10 MiB bound and match the
  namespace relay's limit, so later MCP calls retain their client identities.
  Prelude timeouts, empty-completion checks and retry safety remain intact.
- **DeepSeek empty-completion guard allows large reasoning after liveness
  release.** Issue #684: Direct DeepSeek V4.1 Flash MCP turns with large
  reasoning deltas no longer hit the empty-completion byte limit prematurely.
  After liveness is established (by initial reasoning or content), the guard
  uses a 10MB limit for incomplete SSE blocks instead of the 1MB pre-liveness
  limit. This accommodates legitimate large reasoning events delivered in
  small network chunks while still protecting against unbounded/malformed
  streams. Fixes #684.
- **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash is available on four providers, alongside V4.**
  DeepSeek released V4.1 Flash on 2026-09-10. New routes:
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` (1M window, image input, thinking with
  low/high/max), `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash` (OpenCode's renamed id;
  the launch-day `deepseek-flash` id is deprecated and not routed),
  `nousresearch/deepseek-v4.1-flash` (sized to the Portal's served 262,144
  window), and `commandcode/deepseek-v4.1-flash` (text-only until image input
  is verified at the Provider API). Every V4 route stays listed. On the
  DeepSeek API the V4 Flash ids are now served by V4.1 Flash, and from
  2026-09-14 04:00 UTC `deepseek-v4-pro` requests are served by V4.1 Flash too.
  Ollama Cloud and ClinePass do not offer V4.1 Flash yet. Evidence is in
  `docs/research/deepseek-v4-1-flash-2026-09-11.md`.
- **Routed workers expose read-only request progress.** `bin/control activity
  [thread-id]` reports active requests and bounded recent outcomes behind the
  caller capability, including observed stream events and cancellation causes.
  Quiet polling never ends a request, and the shipped agent guidance separates
  polling intervals from worker deadlines.
- **Grok repairs require a successful response terminal.** Failed, incomplete,
  and truncated streams return a terminal error without releasing withheld
  client actions or private final answers. Reasoning remains live.
- **Grok gateway stream errors reach Codex as terminal failures.** Untyped
  gateway errors are normalized without exposing upstream diagnostics or
  appending empty message closes, and request activity records the failure.
- **Grok compaction keeps the Grok transport bounds, and a failed Grok turn
  stays a failure when the client leaves.** A Grok OAuth compaction now uses
  the same long-idle router pool and gateway `timeout` as a streamed turn, so a
  long summary is no longer cut off by the 300-second Undici or 600-second
  gateway defaults. A Grok turn that already delivered a terminal error is
  metered and reported in `/activity` as a failure even if the client then
  closes the still-open stream, which the WebSocket edge does five seconds
  after a failure; it used to read as a user cancellation.
- **Grok OAuth streams survive long reasoning pauses end to end.** After the
  prologue is released, a Grok OAuth turn uses a ten-minute stall bound
  (`CODEX_ROUTER_GROK_STREAM_STALL_MS`, positive milliseconds; invalid or
  timer-unsafe values keep the default) instead of the 30-second prelude. Every
  hop on that path now outlasts the bound: the router's gateway pool and the
  forwarder's xAI pool used to end a silent stream after five minutes with
  `UND_ERR_BODY_TIMEOUT`, and the gateway after ten. While the stream is silent
  the router also relays a `response.in_progress` heartbeat
  (`CODEX_ROUTER_GROK_HEARTBEAT_MS`, default one minute), because Codex abandons
  a stream after five minutes without a data event and sends the whole turn
  again, billing it a second time. Other providers keep their existing bounds
  and receive no heartbeat. Visible streams are never replayed.
- **A failure an upstream states before any content reaches the client at once.**
  The empty-completion guard held a pre-content `error`, `response.failed`, or
  `response.incomplete` until its prelude limit and then reported a second,
  invented failure. It now releases the upstream's own verdict immediately and
  never retries it. On the WebSocket edge, a stream that stays open after a
  failure is drained for at most five seconds, so the client's next request on
  that socket is not queued behind it.
- **A Grok attempt is sealed by its first terminal event.** A tool call, text, or
  second terminal arriving after `response.completed` can no longer add a client
  action or change the outcome, and the forwarder stops reading there. An
  optional progress-only retry that fails, is incomplete, or ends without a
  terminal keeps the first, already-successful answer instead of replacing it
  with an error. Provider-reported counts from a rejected attempt are logged.
- **Fast is never sent where it was not offered.** A routed body keeps
  `service_tier` only when the route serving it advertises that tier, so a
  `priority` request on `grok-oauth/grok-4.6` no longer reaches a failover
  candidate or a compaction for another route, while a curated model that
  advertises a tier still receives it. A usage row covering two attempts no
  longer carries one attempt's tier.
- **Request activity is accurate on every path.** The routed transport retry and
  failover candidates count as observed attempts, a candidate waiting for
  headers is attributed to itself, and a `response.completed` carrying a failed
  or incomplete status settles as `failed` with `terminalStatus`. Client
  disconnects on native image/search and embeddings requests settle as
  `canceled`; a canceled native stream used to record `completed` with status
  200. `codex-router.ps1 activity` is the Windows entry point. Grok-only
  diagnostics no longer follow a turn onto another provider, and run reports
  total billed tokens for collapsed retries.
- **Structured patch paths that a native header trim would change are refused**,
  including trailing U+0085. The CI test job and `npm test` now fail a hung test
  instead of holding a runner for six hours.
- **The ChatGPT Web provider is removed: using it risked an OpenAI account
  ban.** `chatgpt-web` routed Codex turns into an unofficial browser automation
  of chatgpt.com, driven through a separately installed launcher on loopback
  port 17841. Automating a ChatGPT account that way is outside OpenAI's terms of
  service, and enforcement falls on the signed-in account: a suspension or
  permanent ban costs the operator their ChatGPT subscription and their Codex
  access with it. That is not a risk this router should carry behind a warning,
  so the integration is gone rather than deprecated. Removed the provider
  definition, its seven curation routes, the launcher metadata and catalog
  handling in curation and discovery, the user-model slug rule, and the setup
  documentation. The direct Responses contract existed only to serve it and
  goes with it: `src/direct-responses-provider.mjs`, the router's
  `directResponses` dispatch and error passthrough, the failover and
  vision-bridge exclusions, the registry validation, and the client publication
  filter. No other provider declared `directResponses`, `codexOnly`, or
  `explicitSelection`, so every route now takes the ordinary routed path.
  **Anyone who curated `chatgpt-web/*` rows should stop using them and delete
  them** with `bin/curate-models chatgpt-web --remove <slug>` before updating;
  after the update those entries reference a provider that no longer exists and
  are skipped at load with a `Skipped user model: ... references unknown
  provider chatgpt-web` warning, so nothing breaks, but the stale rows stay in
  `user-models.json` until removed.
- **A new native model no longer stays invisible after a Codex upgrade.** The
  account catalog endpoint gates its model list on `client_version`, but the
  router replayed the ETag it had cached under the *previous* version. The
  server answered `304`, and the router then restamped that pre-upgrade body
  with the new version — so `cacheIsFresh` passed forever, the model
  fingerprint never moved, drift never fired, and GPT-6-Astra never reached the
  picker while the router was installed (issue #645). A `client_version` change
  now sends an unconditional request, and a `304` answering an unconditional
  request is treated as a failure rather than blessing the stale body.
  Revalidation within one `client_version` is unchanged.
- **An outdated `codex` on PATH can no longer strip a model out of Codex's own
  cache.** The same endpoint gates its list on `client_version` — measured
  live, `0.150.0` is not offered `gpt-6-astra` while `0.153.4` is. When the
  Codex the router resolves is older than the client that last wrote
  `models_cache.json`, the refresh now declines to write (`stale-client`)
  instead of replacing the richer list with its own poorer one.
- **A missing native capture now counts as catalog drift.** With
  `native-models.json` absent, `nativeCatalogDriftDetected()` returned "nothing
  to compare" and the startup reconciliation never republished, stranding the
  picker on whatever was last written even as the account gained models. A
  missing capture alongside a valid account cache is maximal drift, and
  republishing re-captures from that cache.
- **Native collaboration relay auth and quota failures preserve their semantics.**
  When the native Codex relay needed to open a routed subagent payload receives
  HTTP 429, the router now preserves that status instead of rewriting it to
  502. The exact account-and-ciphertext refusal is remembered for a short,
  bounded interval so immediate client retries fail locally without spending
  another native relay request; other accounts and payloads remain isolated.
  A native 401 is also preserved with a sanitized local error, allowing Codex's
  own ChatGPT authentication recovery to refresh the session and retry without
  exposing the upstream response body.
- **Five more coding clients can be published to from the Harness page.**
  opencode, pi, omp (oh-my-pi), Command Code, and Hermes Agent each keep their
  providers in a configuration document the user also owns, so one shared
  publisher (`src/routed-harness-*.mjs`) writes the single `codex-router`
  provider key each of them reads and leaves every other byte alone.
  **Set up** installs the client's CLI where this router can (updating a
  Command Code older than 1.30.0, the first release that reads
  `providers.json`) and publishes the whole routed catalog in one action; omp
  and Hermes install from their own instructions first; `control client-setup <id>` and
  `control client-disconnect <id>` are the same thing from a terminal. Clients
  that speak the Responses API reach the authenticated loopback `/v1` path with
  the router's own slugs; Command Code and Hermes, which have no Responses
  client, reach the same Anthropic Messages surface Claude Code uses with
  `codex_router/anthropic/<slug>` ids. Enabling a provider, storing a key, or
  curating a model republishes all five alongside the existing clients, and a
  caller-capability rotation refreshes them. YAML documents are spliced by line
  range so comments and sibling providers survive; a JSON document the router
  cannot round-trip is refused rather than reformatted; a `codex-router`
  provider whose base URL this router did not issue is never replaced or
  removed; and opencode's default model is claimed only when the user has not
  chosen one. Devin CLI and T3 Code are deliberately not rows: Devin CLI has no
  custom base URL, and T3 Code drives whichever official CLI is already routed.

- **Command Code forced tool choices now use the same bounded alias as the tool definition.**
  The 64-character compatibility added in #643 shortened provider-facing tool names but
  left an object 	ool_choice at the client's original spelling, so a forced long tool
  could still be rejected as unknown. Forced choices for both Command Code variants now
  pass through the same reversible namespace alias map as the advertised tools.

- **Router-injected subagent interrupts now keep unique call IDs across turns.**
  Streamed collaboration cleanup previously numbered injected `interrupt_agent`
  calls from `call_router_interrupt_1` inside each request-scoped transform, so
  a later turn could reuse an ID still present in Codex conversation history.
  Stream and non-stream injection now share a UUID-backed call-ID generator,
  preserving call/output pairing across long multi-turn agent sessions.
- **OpenCode Go Muse Responses routes can continue after a completed web search.**
  Live replay probes for Muse Spark 1.2 and 1.3 Contributor confirmed that the
  Responses upstream accepts completed `web_search_call` history even though
  neither route advertises a new search tool. Both exact routes now declare
  `supportsSearchHistory: true`, so follow-up and compact turns preserve that
  verified history instead of failing locally with `model_search_not_supported`
  (issue #639).
- **Startup now repairs drifted routed-agent definitions.** The post-health
  native-catalog reconciliation also compares Codex Router's managed agent
  files with the current routed-model, visibility, and subagent settings. A
  missing, stale, unprotected, or extra managed definition triggers the same
  locked picker republish even when native model metadata itself is unchanged.
  Foreign/unreadable Codex transport state remains write-free.
- **The dashboard 24H chart now covers the exact rolling 24-hour window.** The
  hourly rollup added in #644 aligned bars to clock hours but began at the
  next whole hour after `now - 24h`, dropping up to almost one hour of valid
  traffic. The router and legacy renderer fallback now retain both partial edge
  hours while filtering events to the exact half-open `[now - 24h, now)` window.
- **Command Code no longer rejects a routed turn over a long tool name or a
  recursive schema.** A Codex turn carrying a client tool such as
  `mcp__openai_api_key_local_confirmation__confirm_openai_api_key_local_destination`
  (80 characters) was refused before generation with ``HTTP 400: `name` must be
  at most 64 characters, got 80``, and the turn behind it then hit
  `Recursive JSON schemas are not currently supported` (issue #626).
  `chatProviderToolSurface()` now sends both `commandcode` and
  `commandcode-messages` through the router's existing bounded alias route at
  64 characters, and both variants join the non-recursive schema repair. The
  aliases stay deterministic and reversible, so a call the model makes under
  the bounded spelling is restored to the client's own tool identity. Every
  other non-Groq provider keeps its tool surface byte for byte.

- **The macOS tray no longer spawns a Node process every second to read
  health.** `refreshActivity()` polls health once a second and ran
  `bin/control health --json` each time, which boots Node and control.mjs's
  whole module graph to make one loopback GET: about a second of CPU per call,
  so an idle tray pegged a core for as long as it ran (measured 93.6% CPU,
  1450 ms wall and 1000 ms CPU per poll, against 1.4 ms for the same GET over
  plain HTTP). The tray now reads the protected health leaf directly with
  `URLSession`, behind the same caller key and the same 3 s timeout. It decodes
  every HTTP response, so a 503 still carries the degraded list and service
  rows; transport failures throw and are recorded exactly as a failed
  `control health` was. `control-health.mjs` remains the contract for the CLI
  and the Control Center. The bounded one-second polls during MLX install,
  runtime update, and vision-bridge pull still shell out and are unchanged.

- **Tok/s meter now excludes reasoning tokens and hides during generation.**
  `observedTokensPerSecond` used full `outputTokens` while TTFT waited for the
  first *visible* token. Providers often include `reasoning_tokens` (silent
  thinking) in `output_tokens`, inflating reported speed (~+24% measured on
  Muse Spark free: 502 output with 98 reasoning → 163.6 tok/s vs ~131.6 when
  reasoning excluded). `normalizeTokenUsage` now extracts `reasoningTokens`
  from `output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` /
  `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` / `reasoning_tokens` when
  present. `aggregateProviderUsage` and Control Center `tokensPerSecondFromEvent`
  subtract reasoning from the tok/s numerator to match industry TTFT on first
  visible token. Provider totals and billing still count full output. Panel and
  tray status chips now hide the measured median while generating, showing only
  "— tok/s" and "Appears after a metered reply" during active turns. Historical
  events without `reasoningTokens` are unchanged. Also fixes chat first-token
  detection: `chat.completion.chunk` often has no `type` field, so checking type
  before delta meant chat TTFT never fired and tray speed stayed null.

- **Startup prunes `enabled-providers.json` entries that cannot authenticate.**
  Unknown ids (version skew) and recognised providers without a credential
  were left in the selection file forever, so the dispatcher still treated
  them as enabled and answered `provider_api_key_missing`. Startup now
  rewrites the file to the configured subset (and deletes a file that named
  only unknown ids, preserving the no-file show-all fallback). Idempotent;
  discovery-disabled and show-all modes are left alone.
- **macOS KeepAlive no longer uses launchd `Adaptive`, which starved startup.**
  Adaptive only boosts on XPC transactions; the router is localhost HTTP, so
  the job stayed at Background. Node OAuth/API forwarders then missed the 30s
  health budget, `KeepAlive` restart-looped, and tray Update / doctor --fix
  waited 300s on `/health` and rolled the checkout back. The LaunchAgent now
  renders `ProcessType=Standard`. Do not revert to `Background` (LiteLLM
  starved to ~4% CPU in `fb40f8c`).
- **Grok OAuth post-tool turns no longer stay silent while their repair is
  certified.** The forwarder now opens a streamed Chat Completions response as
  soon as xAI returns its headers and relays reasoning immediately, while still
  withholding the short visible sentence that may be a progress-only stop.
  A certified retry supplies the final answer or tool call; an invalid repair
  ends the already-open stream with one terminal error and never emits
  `[DONE]`. Retry and failure logs now include per-attempt header, first-event,
  and total timings plus the safe `x-grok-req-id`, so upstream silence can be
  distinguished from router-side staging without logging prompt or output.

- **Routed reasoning models no longer leak `<think>` chains into the visible
  answer.** Qwen (and other reasoning models bridged through LiteLLM's
  chat-completions path) sometimes emit their chain-of-thought inline in the
  content channel as `<think>...</think>` instead of on the reasoning channel,
  so LiteLLM relays it as `output_text` and the answer renders behind the
  model's reasoning — or behind a bare `</think>` when the open tag is consumed
  upstream but the close is not. A new `ReasoningTagStripper` egress transform
  (`src/reasoning-tag-stripper.mjs`) removes `<think>...</think>` spans and
  orphan tags from the message text across the streamed `output_text.delta`s
  (buffering a tag split across deltas), the terminal `output_text.done`, and
  the stored message item. It covers the reasoning-delimiter family the model
  varies to (`think`/`thinking`/`reason`/`reasoning`), leaves the structured
  reasoning channel and every non-message item untouched, and passes clean
  answers through unchanged. Routed providers only.

- **Routed turns that mix assistant text and a tool call no longer render
  twice.** LiteLLM's chat-completions-to-Responses bridge
  (`use_chat_completions_api`) could leave the assistant `message` item open
  across a `function_call` item and emit its `output_item.done` late, so Codex
  committed the streamed text once while it was live and again when the delayed
  close arrived — the same sentence appeared twice, with the tool call after it.
  It surfaced intermittently on qwen-plan turns that both speak and call a tool.
  A new `ItemLifecycleNormalizer` egress transform (`src/item-lifecycle-normalizer.mjs`),
  added last in the routed-provider response pipeline, holds events for a
  newly-opened output item until the currently-open item closes, restoring the
  Responses contract that every item is `done` before the next
  `output_item.added`. It reorders only — no event body is added, dropped, or
  rewritten — and engages only when the upstream actually interleaves; clean
  streams and native OpenAI streams pass through unchanged.

- **A Grok OAuth outage now terminates streamed Codex turns instead of leaving
  a stale Working badge.** After the local gateway has exhausted its bounded
  retries, a final Grok 5xx on an explicitly streamed Responses request is
  returned as one terminal SSE `error` event. Non-streaming Grok calls,
  actionable 4xx failures, and every other provider retain their HTTP status
  and JSON body, while usage metering still records Grok's real failure status.

- **Empty `tools: []` is now stripped for all API-forwarder routes, not only
  `qwen38-community`.** Strict upstreams (vLLM >=0.20 Pydantic) refuse an empty
  tools array. Codex sends `tools: []` on compaction and plain chat, so without
  this strip every compaction against strict providers 400s. The repair was
  previously applied only to the `qwen38-community` profile; it is now applied
  to all routes so compaction and plain chat work against any strict provider.
  Dangling `tool_choice` is dropped only after stripping an empty `tools: []`
  array (not when tools was never present). The `qwen38-community` profile
  additionally drops tool_choice when tools is absent, as that endpoint refuses
  "When using `tool_choice`, `tools` must be set". Real non-empty tool arrays
  and their tool_choice are forwarded unchanged. (Fixes #588)
- **Grok OAuth reasoning summaries now appear in Codex while the model is
  thinking.** LiteLLM can open an empty assistant message before Grok's first
  reasoning delta, then assign a different item id to every delta and return
  the terminal reasoning item in Chat Completions shape. Codex discarded that
  orphaned lifecycle and showed no progress until answer text arrived. The
  router now repairs only Grok OAuth event streams into one canonical Responses
  reasoning item, preserves valid streams, and keeps the following message and
  tool output indexes consistent.

- **A `Retry-After` expressed as a date is now honored.** RFC 9110 allows
  `Retry-After` to carry either delay-seconds or an HTTP-date. The router read
  the header as a bare number, so a dated value became `NaN` and every consumer
  discarded it: a burst 429 that named its own window did not qualify for
  failover, no provider cooldown was recorded, and the translated error lost
  its "retry in about Ns" hint. The turn therefore died on a provider that had
  said exactly when it would be back, and each later turn paid the same refusal
  again for the length of the window. The header now goes through the same
  `resetAt` parser the `x-ratelimit-*` snapshot already used, which reads
  delay-seconds, an HTTP-date, and a Go-style duration alike, and
  `api-forwarder`'s private copy of that conversion is gone in favor of the
  shared one, so there is one place the header is read.
- **A 429 that named no wait no longer advises retrying "in about 0s".**
  `headers.get` answers null for a header that was never sent and
  `Number(null)` is `0` — a finite value, so the rate-limit message quoted a
  zero-second wait as though the provider had asked for one. Absence and an
  unparseable value now read as no window at all, while a delay of `0` (which
  RFC 9110 permits) and a date that has already passed are kept as the zero
  they are, because a provider saying "now" is not a provider saying nothing.
  Only a positive wait is worth wording, so both zeroes reach the operator as
  "Wait a bit and retry."
- **Pin Gemini 3.8 Flash, Muse Spark 1.3, Claude Fable 5.1, and additional
  models across providers.** Confirmed routes 2026-09-03: Gemini 3.8 Flash on
  OpenRouter, Command Code, Nous Research, and Venice; Muse Spark 1.3 and 1.3
  Contributor on OpenRouter, Nous Research, and opencode Go Responses; Claude
  Fable 5.1 on OpenRouter, Command Code Messages, Nous Research, and Venice;
  Command Code Qwen3.8 Max 0902 and GLM-5.3-Flash; opencode Go Messages
  Qwen3.8 Flash. No new `multiAgentVersion: "v2"` stamps. Updated Command Code
  curation allowlists for the new Chat and Messages ids.
- **OpenCode Free Responses now lists Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor Free.** The
  anonymous Zen Responses route now includes both `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free`
  and `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`. Same documented exception: no API key
  needed, but the free catalog can vanish and Meta may train on these turns.
- **Qwen Plan collaboration calls are now restored to namespaced shape.** Qwen
  Plan (Alibaba Model Studio Token Plan) returns Codex v1 collaboration calls
  as pre-flattened names (`multi_agent_v1__spawn_agent` with no namespace),
  which Codex Desktop rejects. The Responses adapter now rebuilds the namespace
  from flattened tool names that came from actual `type: "namespace"` entries or
  from known collaboration namespaces (`multi_agent_v1`, `collaboration`), so
  Desktop receives `spawn_agent` in the `multi_agent_v1` namespace instead.
  MCP-style names like `mcp__node_repl__js` are left unchanged unless they came
  from a real namespace tool, avoiding false restoration of tools that happen to
  contain `__` (#568).
- **An exhausted opencode Go plan no longer withdraws opencode Zen, or the
  reverse.** Provider cooldowns were keyed by the canonical provider id, which
  is the right identity for a protocol variant — opencode's Messages and
  Responses routes are one subscription behind two wire formats, so one being
  empty means all of them are. Zen is the exception the code already names in
  `cooldownScope`: it shares Go's credential and selection toggle but is billed
  separately at its own endpoint. Filing both windows under the parent meant a
  closed Go plan silently answered a Zen turn from a different provider
  (`reason=cooled_until_...`), and an exhausted Zen balance withdrew the whole
  Go subscription — in both directions a paid route taken away for a window its
  provider never named for it. Windows are now keyed by cooldown scope
  wherever they are recorded, read, cleared, or ranked — including the vision
  bridge's engine selection, which read a window its own writer files under a
  different key — and `api-forwarder` passes the provider id through
  unresolved so the scope is decided in one place. Protocol variants still
  share a window, which is what the existing family test holds.
- **The Windows Control Center no longer flashes PowerShell windows.** A console
  process spawned by a parent that has no console of its own — the Electron
  Control Center and the tray — gets its own window unless `windowsHide` is set,
  and four background helpers were missing it. The one every private write
  reaches meant a burst of visible windows on each status refresh, which is why
  it showed up on every message sent (#565). The private-file ACL writer and its
  verifier, scheduled-task registration, and the tray's task-state poll now all
  hide. Interactive prompts are untouched: they inherit a console the operator is
  already looking at, and hiding it would ask for input through a window nobody
  can see. A source-level test holds the line, since the failure is invisible off
  Windows.
- **A failed Windows scheduled-task launch now explains itself.** Node reports a
  module it cannot *read* exactly as it reports one that is not there —
  `Cannot find module` with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` — so an install whose checkout
  the task's own token cannot read looked like a missing `src\start.mjs` that
  the operator could open in front of them (#548). Readiness failure now checks
  whether the path the loader named exists: if it does, it reports a permission
  or token problem and how to confirm it, and if it does not, it reports an
  incomplete checkout. When the log carries no such evidence the original
  wording is kept rather than a cause being invented. This improves the
  diagnosis only; the underlying ACL condition is not yet reproduced.
- **The Codex picker now shows vendor groups.** Codex sorts its model picker by
  each entry's `priority`, never by catalog order, and routed models reused
  the same low integers as native GPT entries, so DeepSeek and Grok routes
  interleaved with GPT models and the vendor grouping the catalog always
  carried never reached the screen (#544). Routed models that are not
  certified v2 spawn routes are now published in a band above the highest
  visible native priority, in vendor-group order. A certified v2 route keeps
  its authored priority, because that value is what keeps it inside Codex's
  small spawn-model override window; renumbering it would crowd it out. Only
  the published entry changes: failover ranking, the vision bridge, and every
  other client keep reading the registry's authored value.
- **Grok OAuth no longer replays a known progress-only sentence after an
  aborted follow-up.** The first affected turn remains fully live. Once a
  conversation has actually produced the progress-only shape, later
  user-message turns buffer only a short visible prefix while leaving the
  response head and preceding reasoning live. A real tool call or longer
  answer releases that prefix immediately; an upstream abort reports its terminal
  stream error without first committing the same status sentence to Codex
  again. Evidence is retained in a bounded in-memory conversation set.

- **Request bodies are decompressed off the event loop, and an oversize zstd
  frame is refused from its header.** Codex zstd-compresses every request, so
  the router inflated a buffer that grows with the conversation on the thread
  serving every other request, through the one-shot synchronous decoder. That
  path is the one implicated in an intermittent native abort on Windows
  (#465: exit `0xC0000409` with no JavaScript frame, always late in a long
  session, always right after a successful turn), which took every listener
  down with it. The router now reads the size a Zstandard frame declares and
  answers 413 before any native decoder runs when it exceeds the decode cap,
  and inflates everything else through the asynchronous decoder under the same
  cap. The crash has not been reproduced outside Windows, so this is
  defensive hardening rather than a confirmed fix; the issue stays open for a
  crash dump.
- **Antigravity OAuth now uses an operator-owned, fail-closed sign-in.** The
  router requires one matching Google Desktop-app client ID/secret pair,
  collects it through an ephemeral IPv4 loopback listener, and stores the pair
  privately with the refresh session on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It no longer
  borrows the official `agy`/IDE credential or identity, copies a secret into
  service definitions, or provisions a project during sign-in. The route stays
  disabled until a separately confirmed, quota-consuming live probe succeeds
  with the truthful `codex-router` identity; incompatible legacy records are
  preserved until the operator explicitly disconnects them. Its forwarder is
  not spawned or health-gated before proof. A passing probe is persisted as a
  generation-bound pending activation that remains unpublishable until the
  restarted local stack is fully healthy; failed startup, process death,
  credential replacement, and disconnect cannot promote it. Thus an unused
  provider port cannot take down the router or leave an unready route exposed.
  Pre-activation v2 proof records are deliberately unverified and require a
  fresh explicit probe rather than being grandfathered past this readiness gate.
  An authorization-code `invalid_client` rejection also tombstones only the
  exact credential-and-proof snapshot submitted with that same client pair;
  concurrent replacements and unrelated attempted clients remain untouched.
  The Control Center gives the live request, restart readiness, exact-generation
  confirmation, and client publication one shared ten-minute deadline, with a
  separate one-minute command-runner cleanup margin, so a wedged command tree
  can be terminated without shortening the cooperative activation budget. On
  Windows, bounded children start suspended in a kill-on-close Job Object, get
  only dedicated standard handles through an explicit inheritance allowlist,
  and remain attached to the console for interactive operations; restricted
  PowerShell hosts fail before launching the mutation.

- **Support bundles now always omit historical logs.** A log may contain a
  credential that was later rotated or deleted, so current-secret discovery
  cannot prove any historical tail safe. Bundles retain redacted generated
  diagnostics and log-file metadata without copying arbitrary log contents;
  the former `--include-logs` switch remains accepted as a deprecated no-op.
- **OpenClaw is now a one-click routed client.** The Harness page can install
  the official `openclaw@latest` package when it is missing and publish every
  selected router model through a private `codex-router` Responses provider.
  The integration preserves unrelated OpenClaw config and user-selected
  defaults, participates in shared catalog refresh and caller-key rotation,
  and is available as `--target openclaw` on POSIX and Windows.

- **Muse Spark 1.2 Contributor no longer fails on recursive Codex tool
  schemas through OpenCode Go.** Console Go rejects the whole Responses turn
  before inference when this model receives a recursive local JSON-Schema
  reference. The router now breaks only cycle-closing reference edges for the
  paid Muse route, preserving definitions, acyclic references, and sibling
  constraints. Other Console Go Responses models retain their existing schema
  payloads until they demonstrate the same restriction.

- **OpenCode Console Go chat models no longer reject ambient hosted-search
  options.** Codex can attach `web_search_options` even when the selected
  OpenCode Go model does not advertise hosted search; Console Go forwards the
  unknown field to its strict Chat Completions backend, which rejects the
  entire turn with HTTP 400. The router now removes only that unsupported
  option for the `opencode-go` provider on ordinary and compaction requests,
  with the API forwarder enforcing the same boundary. Other search payloads
  and providers that accept the option remain unchanged.

- **Strict generic providers no longer receive unadvertised hosted-search
  extensions.** Codex may attach `web_search`, `web_search_preview`,
  `web_search_options`, and search-only `include` entries even when the chosen
  routed model does not advertise search. The router now removes only those
  hosted-search artifacts at its managed Responses boundary for unsupported
  runtime-generic routes, while preserving ordinary functions (including one
  named `web_search`), capable models, and direct gateway traffic. An explicit
  request that can no longer satisfy `tool_choice` fails locally with a named
  400 instead of reaching a strict upstream as an ambiguous request. Failover
  also preserves the source model's hosted-versus-standalone search mode for
  search-capable turns and refuses to guess after search history exists.

- **Reinstalling over a state directory owned by another checkout no longer
  deadlocks.** The installers recorded the state directory's new owner only
  after the background service reported healthy, while the service itself
  refuses to boot for as long as the record still names another checkout
  (`foreign_state_owner`): an install that followed one from a different
  checkout crash-looped for the full 300-second readiness budget, rolled
  back, and repeated on every retry, and deleting the whole state directory
  -- every stored provider key with it -- was the only escape. The record now
  precedes the service step it describes, so the service boots against its
  own ownership. The ownership override the installers run under is scoped
  to that full, ownership-transferring install on both platforms: a
  prepare-only run meets the guard like any other writer (and the Windows
  installer restores the caller's environment when it finishes). Linux
  readiness also fails fast once the service manager's restart counter shows
  a crash loop, instead of waiting out the whole budget, and names the
  journal and the router log in the error; the counter query itself is
  killed inside a bounded slice of the remaining budget, so a blocked
  `systemctl` cannot stretch the wait, and a health answer that lands as the
  threshold is crossed still wins over the crash-loop verdict.

- **OpenCode Go Kimi K2.7 Code now accepts current Codex tool schemas.** Its
  Moonshot-backed validator receives the same bounded decorated-`$defs` repair
  as the first-party Kimi routes. The compatibility gate names only this
  observed Console Go model, so unrelated OpenCode Go routes keep their tool
  payloads unchanged.

- **Translated tool streams no longer expose bridge-only assistant turns.**
  Bounded, fail-open normalization removes only empty assistant envelopes that
  LiteLLM's Chat Completions and Anthropic Messages bridges corroborate with a
  completed tool lifecycle, then compacts the affected output indexes. Real
  text, reasoning, refusals, malformed or ambiguous streams, and native
  Responses routes remain untouched. Non-streaming bodies receive equivalent
  bounded, fail-open handling under an exact terminal-output proof. Direct
  DeepSeek keeps its narrower provider-specific proof: the historical
  no-prelude bridge drops its corroborated private-reasoning blank, while the
  current bridge reconstructs candidate-attached reasoning under the terminal
  reasoning ID and removes only the separately corroborated blank output.

- **Live model certification now proves the requested route.** Compatibility
  and smoke probes disable router failover, so a healthy alternate can no
  longer certify a broken preset. Direct probes retained GLM-5.3-Flash on
  OpenCode Go, OpenRouter, and Z.ai Coding; the unproved Command Code, Nous
  Research, and Venice Flash presets were withdrawn. Command Code's Ox Alpha
  id returned `model_unavailable` on every exact surface, while the available
  Venice account was billing-blocked before its Ox route could be certified,
  so neither Ox preset ships. Provider discovery remains available for explicit
  per-machine curation without presenting catalog presence as wire proof.
  Curated models now inherit a request profile only when every checked-in route
  in that provider family has the same non-empty profile, so a model-specific
  repair such as OpenRouter Flash's `ox-alpha` profile cannot leak onto an
  unrelated model selected from the same catalog.

- **Router retention and concurrency now stay bounded without crossing native accounts.**
  Request bodies and buffered upstream errors have explicit byte ceilings,
  active turns retain truthful accounting after tray records expire, and a
  separate 24-hour execution deadline protects abandoned work. Encrypted
  collaboration relays coalesce only within the same resolved native account;
  one canceled waiter cannot stop another, while the shared read is aborted
  when every waiter leaves. Aggregate limits and cache counters are visible
  only through caller-authenticated health.

- **Qwen3.8 Flash and GLM-5.3 full are now pinned on listed providers.**
  Live catalogs confirmed 2026-08-27: OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3.8-flash` and
  `z-ai/glm-5.3`; Command Code `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash` and `zai-org/GLM-5.3`;
  QwenCloud/DashScope `qwen3.8-flash`; Nous Research `qwen/qwen3.8-flash`;
  Venice `z-ai-glm-5-3`; Z.ai API `glm-5.3-flash`. GLM-5.3-Flash was already
  shipped in #466; this adds the full GLM-5.3 on OpenRouter, Command Code, and
  Venice, plus Qwen3.8 Flash on OpenRouter, Command Code, Nous Research, and
  Qwen Plan, plus GLM-5.3-Flash on zai-api.

- **OpenCode Go's Ox Alpha preview has graduated to GLM-5.3-Flash.** The
  authenticated catalog now publishes `glm-5.3-flash` and reports the old
  `ox-alpha-free` ID unavailable, matching OpenCode's current Chat Completions
  table and Z.ai's reveal. The picker now exposes
  `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash` as the named, metered 1M-context multimodal model;
  existing `opencode-go/ox-alpha` and locally curated
  `opencode-go/ox-alpha-free` selections migrate through static aliases,
  and the preview's measured low/high/max effort normalization remains attached
  to the named route. Codex now compacts this route conservatively at 400K after
  large live multimodal histories returned empty completions before the generic
  85% point of its advertised 1M window.

- **OpenRouter now ships Grok 4.6 as a listed route.** The checked-in pin is
  `openrouter/grok-4.6`, upstream id `x-ai/grok-4.6`, 500,000 context with
  auto-compact at 440,000, text+image input, and the low/medium/high reasoning
  ladder (matching Command Code, not Nous Research's xhigh-ladder route).

- **README: Ox Alpha availability updated.** No checked-in Ox Alpha preset
  remains. The withdrawn OpenCode Free, OpenRouter, and Nous routes are gone;
  Command Code directly reported its id unavailable, and Venice could not be
  wire-certified through the available account's billing gate. OpenCode Go,
  OpenRouter, and Z.ai Coding retain their direct-proven named
  GLM-5.3-Flash routes.

## 0.5.0

- **Grok 4.6 ships on opencode Go.** OpenCode's current Go list and endpoint
  table publish `grok-4.6` on `/zen/go/v1/responses` (not chat, not messages).
  The checked-in route is `opencode-go-responses/grok-4.6`, 500,000 context
  with auto-compact at 440,000, text+image, and the low/medium/high/xhigh
  ladder models.dev publishes for this id, defaulting to high. No Free twin
  exists. Grok 4.5 stays on the same Responses variant.

- **Nous Research now lists ~27 new models including Hermes 4, free portal
  routes, and coding flagships.** The checked-in registry adds
  `nousresearch/hermes-4-405b` and `nousresearch/hermes-4-70b`, six free-tier
  routes (`longcat-2.0-free`, `laguna-s-2.1-free`, `laguna-xs-2.1-free`,
  `step-3.7-flash-free`, `hy3-free`, `solar-pro4-free`) tagged Free in the Models
  page, plus coding flagships (DeepSeek V4, Kimi K3, Qwen 3.8/3.7 Max, GLM-5.3/5.2,
  MiniMax M3, Claude Opus/Sonnet/Fable 5, GPT-5.6 Terra, Gemini 3.7 Flash, Grok 4.6,
  and others). 28 listed models total including the existing `ox-alpha`. Routing
  still requires a Nous Portal API key (the `:free` ids are billed through the
  portal credential, not anonymous like OpenCode Free). This is not the full
  372-model catalog.
- **Subagent selection is honoured again.** `applyMultiAgentSettings` only ever
  demoted: it read `disabled` and `hidden` and nothing else, so the three modes
  documented in `.claude/skills/codex-subagents/SKILL.md` — `proven`,
  `selected`, `all` — were inert and every selection an operator had made was
  silently discarded. An install running `mode: selected` with twenty routes
  enabled had four spawnable and one agent definition on disk, while
  `subagents status` cheerfully reported the twenty. The modes work as
  documented again: an explicit `off` still beats every mode, a hidden model is
  never promoted, and only an explicit choice promotes — a machine-local probe
  still promotes nothing on its own. **On upgrade this changes what Codex is
  offered**: an install sitting on `mode: all`, or on `selected` with a stale
  `enabled` list, will advertise those routes as subagents again, which is what
  the setting always said it would do. `mode all` remains "every non-hidden
  model, regardless of whether it works" — verify a route with the agent check
  before relying on it (PR #439).

- **Running the test suite no longer clears the operator's subagent
  definitions.** Four tests in `test/control.test.mjs` pointed
  `MODEL_ROUTER_STATE_DIR` at a temporary directory but left `CODEX_HOME`
  alone. `subagents set` republishes the catalog, and the agent definitions it
  writes are keyed off `CODEX_HOME`, so every `npm test` emptied
  `~/.codex/agents` on the machine running it — seventeen definitions before,
  none after, restored by the next publish, with a doctor `FAIL` as the only
  trace. The publish that clears them also says so now, rather than emptying
  the directory in silence (PR #439).

- **A provider reachable only through the proxy no longer reads as a broken
  one.** The Control Center is launched by the desktop session, so it inherits
  `HTTP_PROXY` from the login environment but nothing telling Node it may use
  it — the address and the permission to use it are separate answers. A
  discovery child then dialled the provider directly and its connect timeout
  was reported as the provider failing, which is how a reachable Venice catalog
  came back as `fetch failed`. Children spawned by the app now read the opt-in
  the install manifest recorded, and only for the install that recorded it;
  only the opt-in is restored, never an address (PR #439).

- **The Models page is one list.** Two sections both changed what ended up in
  the picker, six words described three concepts, and a row jumped to a
  different group the moment its switch was flipped. Provider accounts collapse
  into a connections strip, one **Add models** dialog searches every connected
  catalog, and row order no longer depends on the switches. The Subagents
  column stopped offering a compatibility test that could not enable anything —
  turning the switch on now selects the route and the router publishes it, one
  click from off to spawnable. `docs/SUBAGENT-CERTIFICATION.md` records what
  the five-check certification can and cannot establish, including that checks
  3-5 cannot complete while Codex is signed in with a ChatGPT account, so the
  next reader does not spend provider quota re-learning it (PR #439).

- **Windows startup now fails fast when the scheduled task is dead instead of
  polling health for its whole budget.** Task Scheduler can keep a stale
  instance entry (or a Running state) after the launcher tree behind it has
  died, so `service start` used to spend its entire readiness timeout waiting
  for a router that nothing would ever start (issue #384, PR #387). Readiness
  now reads the task from two places — the COM instance enumeration, and a
  direct scan for a live process whose command line references the generated
  launcher — and once both stop reporting a live launch for longer than a short
  grace, fails with the task's own `LastTaskResult` instead of a generic
  timeout. A task-state query failure is inconclusive and never fails the wait
  by itself, so a restricted shell still receives the full health budget rather
  than a false failure. The health answer itself is normalized to one contract
  before the guard trusts it — healthy only when the router actually answered,
  whether the probe resolves or rejects — and a Windows interpreter probe that
  merely times out under process-launch contention, which is not evidence of a
  broken virtual environment, is retried once with a wider bound before install
  reports a condition that was transient all along.

- **ChatGPT subscription access for non-Codex clients is now an explicit,
  one-time local authorization.** A discovered Codex `auth.json` no longer
  silently lets DeepSeek Harness, Gemini CLI, or another caller-key client
  spend the account. After `codex login`, the user runs `model-router codex
  chatgpt-session enable` once; an owner-only, credential-free marker applies
  that decision to every client on the shared loopback router plane. Disabling
  it revokes native GPT publication everywhere without signing Codex out. A
  missing or malformed authorization and a missing or expired session both
  fail closed. External model routes and Codex's own session pass-through are
  unchanged.

- **Ox Alpha initially shipped on six routes.** The stealth 1M-context reasoning model was
  checked in for `opencode-free` (no key), `opencode-go`, `openrouter`,
  `commandcode`, `nousresearch`, and `venice`, each under the upstream id that
  provider's own live catalog publishes. All six advertise 1,048,576 tokens
  with 131,072 of output, text+image input, and a low/high/max effort ladder
  defaulting to max — the model always thinks, and its upstream refuses any
  other rung by name ("please use low, high, or max"). Venice's catalog
  advertises a fourth rung the model rejects; the model wins, and the
  disagreement is written down rather than silently resolved. A new `ox-alpha`
  request profile clamps the requested effort onto those three rungs, which is
  load-bearing rather than defensive: a Codex older than 0.143 has no `max` in
  its enum, so the catalog sends the clamped `xhigh` and every turn would
  otherwise 400. Only the credential-free route carries curated announcement
  copy; the other five used the automatic announcement once their provider was
  credentialed.

- **Venice and Nous Research (Hermes) are new API-key providers.** Both are
  selectable through `install.sh --providers`, `providers enable`, and the
  tray, both ship a provider mark, and both are covered by `doctor`. Venice
  carries a plan note because a free Venice account has no API entitlement at
  all — API access needs a Pro subscription, a funded USD balance, or staked
  VVV that grants VCU.

- **The tray and control center show what these subscriptions have left.**
  Venice's `api_keys/rate_limits` route is wired into `provider-usage`, so the
  tray reports all three pools that can fund a request (USD, VCU, and the daily
  DIEM allowance) plus the API tier, instead of showing a zero to someone whose
  VCU balance is full. OpenRouter now reports its per-key spend cap from
  `/api/v1/key`, adding the account-wide credit pool when the stored key is a
  management key and keeping the per-key numbers when it is not. Nous Portal
  publishes no credits route at all, so it degrades to its subscription page
  and observed router traffic rather than inventing a number.

- **Private state files are hardened with a canonical owner-only ACL on
  Windows.** The previous Windows path asked `GetAccessControl` about the
  file's existing DACL and then edited it with `SetAccessRuleProtection` and
  `RemoveAccessRuleSpecific`, so a file whose DACL was already non-canonical
  could make it throw (or silently keep foreign ACEs), the exact drift an
  install or `doctor --fix` is meant to repair. Windows hardening now builds a
  fresh, empty `FileSecurity`, replaces the DACL outright with a single
  current-identity FullControl Allow rule and inheritance cleared, and skips
  persisting owner/group so it needs only `WRITE_DAC` and cannot fail where an
  `icacls /inheritance:r /grant:r` path would have succeeded. A hardening
  failure now exits non-zero with the PowerShell diagnosis on stderr instead of
  masquerading as success.

- **MiniMax M3 no longer shows its chain of thought as assistant text.** The
  Token Plan route asked for adaptive thinking but not `reasoning_split`, so
  MiniMax embedded the reasoning in `content` as literal `<think>...</think>`
  markup, which every client that does not know the vendor format rendered as
  ordinary output. Requesting the split moves it to `reasoning_content`, which
  this router already relays as reasoning. Verified against api.minimax.io: the
  same prompt leaks `<think>` into `content` without the flag and carries a
  populated `reasoning_content` with it. Reported in #333 by @moryk87.

- **The harness caller key is written where a current harness reads it.**
  DeepSeek Harness moved `.credentials.yaml` to a `version`/`refs` envelope
  around the reference map, and the router only knew the flat root map the
  older builds used -- so on a current harness it wrote `CODEX_ROUTER_CALLER_KEY`
  one level too high, the harness resolved the route's `apiKeyEnv` under `refs`,
  found nothing, and every turn came back 401 with no diagnostic anywhere
  (reported in #351 by @jepgambardella). Both shapes are now written in place,
  and neither is converted into the other: `refs` present settles it, `version`
  without `refs` settles it the other way -- that is a current harness on its
  first install, the case where guessing wrong is silent -- and a document with
  no references at all adopts the current shape. A new reference follows the
  indentation the envelope already uses for its siblings rather than assuming
  two spaces, since a mixed-indent block is not YAML any parser reads back and
  the file holds every adapter's key, not only ours. Removing the reference
  prunes a `refs:` it emptied, exactly as removing the route prunes an emptied
  `providers:`, so uninstall restores the document byte for byte. `status`
  resolves the credential through the same decision the writer makes, so it can
  no longer report one the harness cannot read. A reference an older build left
  at the root of an enveloped document is moved rather than copied, so uninstall
  no longer leaves a second copy of the caller key behind. Anything that is not
  a reference map in either shape -- a nested mapping at the root, a nested
  mapping inside `refs`, an inline `refs` -- is still refused with the file
  untouched.

- **The Grok OAuth forwarder is health-checked, and a dependency the router
  did not name is no longer reported as unknown.** `/health` probed the Kimi
  OAuth forwarder, the API forwarder, and the gateway, but never the Grok
  OAuth forwarder on its own port -- so an operator routing through Grok OAuth
  got no signal for it at all and the router could answer `ok` with that
  forwarder dead (issue #366). It is now probed like the others, gated on the
  `grok-oauth` provider actually being selected so an unused port is never
  dialled, named as `grokOauth` in `degraded` when it is down, and carried
  through the redacted health projection into the tray and the Control Center,
  which both render it beside the other forwarders. Separately, both surfaces
  fell through to "Unknown / Waiting for health report" whenever a service key
  was simply absent from the payload; a router that reported `ok` has already
  probed every dependency it knows about, so an id missing from `degraded` now
  renders Ready and a healthy install stops looking like it never answered.

- **Curated OpenCode Zen free models now ship the effort ladder and context
  window OpenCode publishes for them, and say which values are still
  guesses.** Zen's anonymous `/models` endpoint returns ids and nothing else,
  and the deterministic curation path is never interactive, so every free
  model landed in the picker with a generic 131,072-token window and a single
  `high` effort no matter what the route actually supported (#352).
  `src/opencode-curation.mjs` now carries OpenCode's own published `limit` and
  `reasoning_options` per *free id* -- adding real windows for
  `nemotron-3-ultra-free` (1,000,000) and `laguna-s-2.1-free` (256,000)
  alongside the two that already had them, and real effort ladders for
  `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free`, `x-preview-f-free`,
  `laguna-s-2.1-free`, `deepseek-v4-flash-free`, and `hy3-free`. A window is
  declared only when curation's 0.85 auto-compact ratio still reserves that
  id's published output limit, so compaction fires before a completion can
  overrun the window the entry just declared; `deepseek-v4-flash-free`,
  `hy3-free`, `mimo-v2.5-free`, and `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` therefore
  keep the conservative default rather than a number a full-length answer
  could walk off the end of. Each entry's description now names the provenance
  of every capability it carries *and* the ones that stayed unknown, so a
  reader can tell a documented value from a default without leaving the file.
  Hand-tuned entries are still never rewritten: the upgrade path touches only
  an entry still holding the untouched generic sizing pair and the untouched
  single-`high` ladder, and an explicit `--efforts` always wins.

- **Kimi OAuth sessions survive the Codex App connector pack.** Moonshot
  accepts a tool-schema `$ref` only when it points into `#/$defs/` and rejects
  the whole request -- not the one tool -- over anything else, so the
  sibling-property pointers connector tools ship (Wego `_flights_search` points
  `inboundTotalDurationRange` at its own sibling `priceRange`) turned every
  `kimi-oauth` App session into an HTTP 400 on its first message (issue #353).
  The relay now inlines those pointers for the kimi route: the node is replaced
  by the schema the client itself pointed at, with any constraint declared
  beside the `$ref` still winning, and `#/$defs/` pointers left exactly as they
  are. A pointer that cannot be resolved is left alone rather than guessed at,
  a cyclic schema stops at the edge that would close the cycle, and an
  expansion that outgrows its byte budget falls back to the original schema
  rather than shipping a duplicated one. Every other provider keeps the payload
  it gets today -- the inlining is scoped to the provider the rejection was
  reproduced on.

- **The macOS tray can load a provider's current model list and curate from
  it.** A new Provider catalogs panel asks any configured provider that
  supports live discovery for the models it serves right now, marks the ones
  already routed, and adds a selection through the same `curate-models.mjs`
  path the desktop app uses -- so the tray no longer has to hand people back
  to a terminal to pick up a model their provider shipped after install. The
  first open is answered from the router's stored list, so it costs no round
  trip and works offline; only Reload re-asks upstream. Model ids coming back
  from a provider are held to the same slug rule the Electron app enforces
  before any of them reaches curation, and every discovery or curation run is
  bounded by the Electron timeouts, so a provider that accepts the connection
  and never answers can no longer wedge the panel's buttons for the rest of
  the session. The panel is translated in all six tray languages.

- **An update no longer empties the picker on a pre-allowlist install.** The
  routed picker became an allowlist in `v0.4.0-beta.4`; on an install written
  by an older build, every routed model was absent from `seeded` rather than
  recorded as visible, so the first catalog rebuild read "on, but never
  written down" as "never decided" and applied the opt-in default to models
  that were plainly already showing (issue #338). The catalog build now
  migrates that file once, before the default runs: a routed slug in neither
  `hidden` nor `seeded` is recorded visible, so the picker the operator was
  looking at survives the update. Models switched off on purpose stay off, and
  a fresh install still opts in model by model.

  **If an update already hid your models,** the migration cannot tell them
  apart from a deliberate hide -- both now sit in `hidden` and `seeded` -- and
  deliberately does not guess. Restore a provider's models with the picker
  command, which republishes the catalog on the way out:

  ```sh
  ./bin/control picker provider opencode-go show
  ```

  Substitute your provider ID (`./bin/model-router codex providers list --json`
  lists them), repeat per provider, then fully quit and reopen Codex.

- **Guided setup asks which models go in the picker.** `./bin/setup --guided`
  now has a model step between choosing providers and connecting credentials.
  It starts from the picker the machine already has -- nothing on a first
  install, the operator's existing selection on a re-run -- so enabling a
  provider still offers its models rather than choosing them, and pressing
  Enter through the step never changes what is already there. The selection is
  written after the "Proceed?" confirmation, so a cancelled setup and a
  `--selection-only` run both leave `model-picker.json` untouched, and it
  records `hidden`/`seeded` rather than an allowlist on a pre-allowlist file,
  because one screen of models cannot answer for the providers it never
  showed.

- **Concurrent Codex turns no longer stall `/health` and the next request.**
  Loopback liveliness probes use a separate dispatcher so they cannot queue
  behind long-lived SSE sockets, and `/health` serves a recent probe result
  immediately while a slow LiteLLM liveliness check refreshes in the
  background. The snapshot is still bounded: once it is older than 15s the
  next `/health` waits for a live probe, so a tray-less `doctor` cannot
  inherit an hours-old "reachable". Probe GETs use undici's own `fetch` with
  that extra Agent (Node's builtin `fetch` rejects an npm-undici dispatcher)
  and the same `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY` selection as routed traffic. The
  process-wide HTTP/1.1 pool stays unbounded -- a numeric `connections` cap
  would queue later turns across every installed client. Disconnect handlers
  are registered before the `JSON.parse` yield so a canceled turn cannot
  start an upstream fetch. The tray was reporting Starting and Codex
  "waiting for network" with two or three in-flight turns even though the
  router was still generating.

- **Homebrew installs can reach every command again.** The formula's PATH shim
  exec'd `bin/model-router codex`, whose fixed whitelist has no entry for
  `curate-models`, `discover-models`, `refresh-catalog`, `test-model`,
  `support-bundle`, or `control` -- so a packaged user had no way to add a
  custom provider's models, and a bare `codex-router` or `codex-router --help`
  printed `model-router`'s usage instead of the packaged command list. The shim
  now dispatches through `bin/codex-router`, which exists for exactly this
  case. `post_install` gets its own private entry point, because
  `bin/codex-router` refuses `install` by design. Reported in #334.

- **GLM-5.3 on opencode Go serves its real 1M context.** The entry still
  carried 200,000/180,000 -- the GLM-5.1 lineage default that #244 established
  is wrong for 5.3, where a live probe accepted 990,020 prompt tokens. Both
  Z.ai GLM-5.3 entries were corrected then; this opencode Go entry was missed,
  so a session was compacting at 180K against a model that serves a million.
  Its GLM-5.1 and GLM-5.2 siblings on the same gateway already declare
  1,048,576, so 1,000,000/900,000 stays conservative against the relay.
  Standalone web search stays off for this route until the opencode Go relay
  is verified to preserve tool/function-call history.
- **External-model compaction now carries evidence-backed `kcr2`
  checkpoints.** The router assigns stable `U/C/R/A` source IDs before tool
  results are aged, accepts only a bounded structured source selection from the
  summarizing model, and derives the trusted section from redacted original
  excerpts and machine-readable tool outcomes. Model prose remains explicitly
  unverified; missing, fabricated, or misclassified references are rejected;
  unresolved unknowns survive repeated compaction; and replay tells the next
  model to re-read mutable state before changing it. New checkpoints are capped
  at 96 KiB after final JSON serialization, with a 32 KiB recent tail. Existing
  source IDs and counters are rejected unless they are positive safe integers;
  the source catalog sent to the model has its own 96 KiB JSON limit, and only
  IDs actually present in that catalog can be selected. Wrapped provider output
  is accepted only when it contains exactly one contract-valid JSON object and
  is no larger than 256 KiB. The latest two user messages are reserved in both
  the source catalog and recent tail. The v1 compact endpoint now replays at
  most those two complete ordinary user messages before the checkpoint instead
  of carrying every short historical instruction that fits its character
  budget; a message that does not fit is never replayed as an unmarked fragment.
  Responses `reasoning` output is now treated only as a draft: KCR2 parses the
  final `message` instead of concatenating both channels and mistaking their
  separate JSON objects for an ambiguous answer. Existing `kcr1` payloads and
  old v1 plain-summary messages still replay but are labeled
  `UNVERIFIED_LEGACY_SUMMARY`. Checkpoint excerpts reuse the managed
  caller-URL redactor and remove recognized GitHub token prefixes before they
  reach either the source catalog or serialized checkpoint. Native OpenAI
  requests still forward their encrypted compaction bytes unchanged.

- **Grok 4.6 can select Codex's native image viewer.** xAI stopped without a
  function call when the tool was named `view_image`, even when selection was
  required. The Grok OAuth boundary now presents that tool as `inspect_image`
  and restores returned calls to `view_image`, without colliding with a real
  client tool of the same alias name. This complements the existing
  image-result transport fix: Grok can now both invoke the viewer and receive
  its returned pixels.

- **Grok OAuth keeps image-bearing tool results multimodal.** The
  Chat Completions-to-Responses hop JSON-stringified every non-string tool
  result, so Codex could complete `view_image` while Grok received JSON and
  base64 text instead of pixels. Structured image output now remains
  `input_image`, preserves detail and mixed-part order, and recovers common
  image MIME types from generic octet-stream data URLs. Text-only and other
  structured tool results keep their previous behavior.

- **A Codex Stop hook continues grok-oauth mid-task stops once.** After a
  tool result, a short status sentence with no follow-up tool call used to
  hand control back. `hooks/codex-stop-grok-oauth.mjs` is a user-level Stop
  hook: it blocks only when `model` is a `grok-oauth/*` slug, the transcript
  shows a tool result then a short status, and `stop_hook_active` is false.
  Native GPT slugs fall through with `{ continue: true }`. Cap is one
  automatic continue. `CODEX_GROK_OAUTH_STOP_HOOK=0` disables it.

- **The routed-model skill says a text-only turn ends the task.** Custom
  models often emit a status sentence after a tool result and call nothing;
  Codex then hands control back. The `codex-router` skill now states that
  contract and tells the model to call the next tool in the same turn when
  work remains. This is instruction, not a protocol fix — the Grok OAuth
  after-tool retry still covers a model that ignores it.

- **Grok OAuth no longer accepts uncertified prose after a tool result as a
  successful completion.** The
  progress-only retry used to classify only on visible-text length and
  output tokens. After a successful tool, a cheap status sentence ("The
  figures are ready.", 95 tokens) never retried, and a reasoning-heavy
  one-liner was nudged with "if you are already done, stop" — so the model
  restated the status and the turn looked finished. The last non-system
  message being a tool result is now the signal, independent of language,
  phrasing, or answer length: a no-tool turn is held and retried once. The
  repair must call exactly one function: either a client tool or the router's
  private final-answer tool. The private tool is converted back to ordinary
  assistant text and never reaches Codex.
  An empty, progress-only, or failed repair becomes an explicit 502 instead
  of a clean `stop`, so Codex cannot record it as a silent success. A
  one-line verdict after a user message still gets the no-tool branch
  first, so a finished Q&A cannot be talked into a call the client would
  run.

- **Grok progress-repair usage separates context from billed spend.** Codex
  now receives the selected repair attempt's prompt count instead of the sum
  of both attempts, preventing a roughly 150k context from appearing as 300k.
  The aggregate provider cost is retained separately as billed input/output
  tokens in the local usage ledger.

- **Grok and DeepSeek advertise Codex reasoning summaries.** The catalog now
  opts the official Grok and DeepSeek thinking models into
  `supports_reasoning_summaries`, so Codex can show their thinking while a
  turn is in flight and collapse it afterwards — the same surface native GPT
  uses. Grok OAuth was dropping xAI's `reasoning_summary_text` /
  `reasoning_text` deltas on the Chat Completions hop; those now land as
  `reasoning_content` so LiteLLM can put them back on the Responses reasoning
  channel. DeepSeek already emitted `reasoning_content`; it only needed the
  catalog flag. `deepseek-chat` stays off because it is the non-thinking
  alias.

- **Grok OAuth retries a progress-only stop once on the user-message path,
  without holding the first byte.** Attempt 1 streams live. If the client offered tools and the turn
  ends with short visible text, no tool calls, and enough output tokens to be
  reasoning-heavy, the forwarder retries once with a trailing user nudge and
  *appends* only the retry's tool-call deltas plus `finish_reason:
  "tool_calls"` onto the same open stream. The first answer is kept when the
  retry also has no tools. This paragraph describes turns following a user
  message; post-tool turns use the stricter certified repair above. Both
  attempts on this older path are summed into `usage` with
  `progress_only_retried: true`; that marker is what `acceptedInputTokens`
  excludes, not a bare transport `retries` count. The retry log is not gated
  on `MODEL_ROUTER_QUIET`. Set `CODEX_ROUTER_GROK_PROGRESS_ONLY_RETRY=0` to
  pay once and see the raw first attempt. `dispatchSseBlock` now catches only
  `JSON.parse`.

  The trigger is a shape and cannot be anything else: a finished task answered
  in one line — "Yes, that is correct." after 1,500 reasoning tokens — is
  indistinguishable from a turn that stopped early, so it is retried too. The
  nudge therefore offers the no-tool branch first ("if that already completed
  the task, restate the final answer and call no tool"), which routes the
  finished case into keep-first. An imperative nudge makes such a turn invent
  a tool call, and the forwarder would graft it onto the answer for the client
  to run. A false positive now costs one round trip, not a wrong action.

- **The Devin CLI probe no longer reports "unknown" for a Devin CLI that is
  installed and working.** `devinCliVersion` was the one call site out of
  twenty that took `command` and `args` from `spawnableCommand` and threw away
  the third field. For a Windows `.cmd` shim — which is what npm installs —
  that field carries `windowsVerbatimArguments`, and without it Node re-quotes
  a command line that has already been escaped for cmd.exe. The version came
  back empty and the probe printed `unknown`, which reads as "you do not have
  the CLI" to the one person running a probe written specifically to stop that
  misdiagnosis. The probe's own convention — every outside edge injectable — now
  covers this edge too, so the options, the cmd.exe hop, and the POSIX
  pass-through are all asserted on every platform rather than only on Windows.

- **The Windows command-line escaping is now pinned against the hazards that
  could not previously be caught off Windows.** `spawnableCommand` builds one
  cmd.exe command line, and until now the only proof it was armed correctly was
  an end-to-end test that runs a real shim and therefore skips everywhere else.
  A pipe, a redirect, a `!`, and a trailing backslash before a closing quote —
  the four that would end the quoted span or start a second command if the
  escaping were wrong — are now asserted in rendered form on every platform,
  and added to the set the Windows job runs for real. No behaviour changed: the
  escaping already matched `cross-spawn` character for character.

- **Running the test suite no longer resets your subagents.**
  `test/state-owner.test.mjs` ran the real `src/catalog.mjs` against a scratch
  state directory while inheriting the developer's own `CODEX_HOME`. No
  state-directory override redirects `$CODEX_HOME/agents`, so the catalog read
  an empty state — no proofs, no selection, no picker — and pruned the real
  agents directory to the handful of models the shipped registry promotes on
  its own, deleting the definition of every model this machine had promoted
  through a local capability probe. The settings naming those models live in
  the state directory and survived, so `subagents status` kept reporting them
  as enabled while Codex had nothing left to spawn: subagents that appeared to
  reset themselves after an unrelated command. The test now isolates the home
  with the state, and a guard in the same file fails if any test spawns the
  catalog without doing so. If your routed agents are already missing, one
  catalog refresh from the owning checkout restores them.
- **A forwarder that cannot bind its port now says so.** The four forwarders
  the service starts — `kimi-oauth`, `api-forwarder`, `grok-oauth`, and
  `devin-cli` — called `listen` with no `'error'` handler, so a port already in
  use killed the process with Node's unhandled-`'error'` crash dump: `throw er`
  and a libuv stack, in a log the four of them share, naming neither the
  forwarder nor the port. Startup then reported only that *some* forwarder had
  exited before becoming healthy. Each one now reports the bind failure the way
  the router already did since #171 — one line naming itself, the address, and
  the reason — and exits with the router's own listen-failure codes (98 for
  `EADDRINUSE`, 97 for `EACCES`, 96 otherwise), so one line in the service log
  classifies the death for a supervisor and a human alike.

- **GPT-5.6 Sol can now run at the 1M context window OpenAI documents for it.**
  The catalog Codex ships declares 272,000 tokens against a documented
  1,050,000, and that figure has already moved twice
  (openai/codex#31860, #32806). Editing `model_context_window` and
  `model_auto_compact_token_limit` in `config.toml` answers this for a whole
  machine; the picker now answers it per task. **GPT-5.6-Sol (1M context)**
  (`gpt-5.6-sol-1m`) is the same upstream model published under a second slug
  with a 1,000,000-token window and compaction starting at 900,000 —
  instructions, reasoning ladder, image input, and subagent behavior are copied
  from `gpt-5.6-sol`, and the router rewrites the slug back to its base before
  the turn leaves, so OpenAI only ever sees the model it published. It ships
  **switched off**, because a turn resends the whole conversation and a request
  above 272,000 input tokens is billed at a higher rate in full: a model that
  costs more than the one it shadows has to be chosen, not discovered after the
  bill. Switch it on under OpenAI in the Settings model list, or with
  `./bin/control picker set gpt-5.6-sol-1m show`. That answer is remembered —
  later catalog rebuilds never re-apply the default to a model already decided,
  in either direction — and a login-free install does not get the entry at all,
  because its native slugs come from a server-supplied allowlist.

- **Gemini CLI is a target.** It speaks only the Gemini API and Google ships no
  bring-your-own-provider setting, so pointing it at this router used to be
  impossible — the endpoint it wants does not exist anywhere in the codebase.
  It does, however, read its endpoint, its credential, and its default model
  from the environment, and `createContentGenerator` builds a plain
  `@google/genai` client from them. So the router now serves
  `/_codex-router/<key>/gemini/v1beta/models/{model}:{method}` and writes one
  marker block into `~/.gemini/.env`. `./install.sh --target gemini` or
  `./bin/model-router gemini enable` sets it up; the next `gemini` run has the
  routed models, with nothing to restart.
  The surface reaches no provider of its own. It translates the turn into a
  Responses request and sends it through the router's existing `/v1/responses`
  over the loopback, so tool-result ageing, the vision bridge, prompt-token
  substitution, upstream retry, model failover, and usage accounting all still
  sit on one request path rather than two that would drift. Tools, system
  instructions, inline images, streaming deltas, reasoning summaries, tool calls
  and their results, usage counts, and finish reasons all cross in both
  directions. A stream the upstream drops still ends with a finish reason,
  because the SDK waits for one before it considers a turn over.
  `settings.json` is never opened for writing: it is JSONC carrying the user's
  own comments, and this integration does not need it. The `.env` block is the
  only thing written, it is 0600 because it holds the caller key, publishing
  twice is byte-identical, and removing it restores the file exactly. A managed
  key assigned outside the block stops the publish with the line named rather
  than being silently overwritten — `dotenv` lets the last assignment win, so a
  duplicate would quietly decide which endpoint is in force and nothing in the
  file would say so.
  The default model is written, unlike the harness integration's opt-in
  equivalent, because Gemini CLI's own default is a Gemini model this router
  does not route: an install that left it alone would 404 on the first turn.
  `--model` still outranks it and `--no-default-model` omits it.
  Embeddings are refused with a named 501 rather than faked, and `countTokens`
  is estimated rather than answered by spending a real turn upstream.
  None of this is documented by Google. The contract was read out of the
  installed `@google/genai` and `@google/gemini-cli-core` bundles and then
  proved by driving the real `gemini -p` at a real provider: a routed turn came
  back through the CLI verbatim, and a tool-calling turn completed the whole
  loop — ten tool schemas out, a tool call in, its result back out, and the
  model's answer in. That live run is what caught the one bug the unit tests
  could not: a Gemini tool declares its schema as `parametersJsonSchema`, not
  `parameters`, so the first cut sent every tool upstream with no schema at all
  and the CLI rejected each call the model made with "params must have required
  property 'file_path'".
- The rule for which models may be published to a client that carries no ChatGPT
  session of its own now lives in `src/routed-client-models.mjs` instead of
  inside the harness manager. It was always a general rule; a second client
  wanting it verbatim is what made a second copy the wrong answer.
- **A subagent that had been proven once could never be un-proven, however
  badly it behaved afterwards.** The observer that settles a locally verified
  subagent gated itself on `awaitingSpawnProof`, which is true only while a
  slug sits in the experimental window — so the instant turn one promoted a
  model, the router stopped watching it. A hard 400/422 on turn two was
  discarded with everything else, and the only thing that could re-examine the
  slug was a hand-run `control subagents verify` (#257). Two changes, both
  about the gate rather than the thresholds. `proven` is now revocable: the
  same structural rejection that would have blocked promotion takes it back
  afterwards, without needing to repeat, because nothing makes a 400 weaker
  after a 200 than before it and the transient statuses that prove nothing
  (429, 5xx, disconnects) were already excluded. Registry-v2 models are
  untouched — their claim is the shipped native collaboration proof, not one
  machine's traffic — and re-promotion stays manual, since that is the
  direction that spends quota. And a child that answers turn after turn
  without converging is now demotable at all: it emits nothing but 200s, so no
  status-shaped branch could ever see it, and the evidence instead is how much
  of its own budget one spawn burns while still going. `src/subagent-turns.mjs`
  accounts each spawn separately by `thread-id` and adds up the new input
  tokens it produces — every child turn resends the whole conversation, so
  growth in the prompt count is what the child newly made, and a compaction
  makes the count fall so everything after it is work being done twice. The
  ceiling is twice the larger of the model's declared `autoCompact` budget and
  the largest prompt the spawn has actually had accepted: one budget is a large
  but legitimate task, and it is compacting *again* without ever finishing that
  names the runaway, which is the same pathology
  `context-window-drift.mjs` and #266 already describe. No round number was
  invented — `autoCompact` is per model and comes from the provider's own
  published window, and a model that declares none is counted but never
  condemned. Measuring against the spawn's own observed peak as well as the
  declaration makes a false demotion impossible rather than merely unlikely: an
  uncompacted spawn's total is exactly half its own ceiling however long its
  task runs, so neither a model whose declared budget sits far below its window
  nor a single oversized tool result can condemn anything. Only prompt counts
  the provider actually reported move the total,
  so substituted estimates and retry-doubled counts cannot manufacture a
  demotion. Both paths log unconditionally and record the turn and token
  counts in the proofs file, so `control subagents status` and the tray say
  what happened rather than a picker entry quietly disappearing.
- **A passing Devin CLI probe now means something.** The provider's Cascade
  transport was transcribed from a shipped binary and has never met Cognition's
  backend, so #270 asks a volunteer with an account to settle it. The probe that
  ask points at printed one line per stage, and every one of those lines could
  pass while the thing it was meant to prove had failed: an empty model list
  read as `OK: account advertises 0 model(s)`, a stream that decoded to nothing
  read as `OK: streamed 0 character(s)`, and a tool call that arrived under a
  field number this build does not know was skipped in silence and reported as a
  model that chose not to call a tool — the one failure that decides whether
  Codex can drive the provider at all. The probe now audits the raw bytes
  alongside the schema and prints a PASS/FAIL line per assumption with the
  observed value on each failure, so a run that reports success has confirmed
  each one separately: request encoding, model list decoding, envelope framing,
  the compression flag, the end-of-stream terminator, stop reason, usage,
  tool-call ids and arguments, and a replay of the captured bytes through the
  client a routed turn actually runs. Where a tool call goes missing, three
  distinct lines separate a renumbered field from a model that declined. The
  live turn is now capped at 64 output tokens and 90 seconds, `--live` remains
  the only flag that spends anything, a mistyped flag fails the run instead of
  quietly downgrading it, and the output folds `$HOME` to `~` and carries no
  token, because it is written to be pasted into a public issue.
  `docs/DEVIN-CLI-PROBE.md` is the tester's copy of all of it.

- **The Devin CLI transport now reports a refusal as a refusal.** Its Connect
  client carried ten of the protocol's sixteen error codes, and the six it did
  not — `canceled`, `already_exists`, `aborted`, `out_of_range`, `data_loss`,
  and `unimplemented` — fell through to 502. Every layer above reads a 5xx as a
  bad moment in the chain rather than an answer: the vision bridge retries it,
  and Codex spends its own reconnects on it. `unimplemented` is what Cascade
  answers when the service path or method name has drifted from the binary these
  schemas were transcribed from, so the one code that can never succeed was the
  one dressed as worth another try. The client now imports the full table from
  `src/connect-stream-audit.mjs` instead of restating half of it, so
  `unimplemented` arrives as 501, `already_exists` and `aborted` as 409,
  `out_of_range` as 400, and `canceled` as 499 — none of them retryable — on
  both the HTTP failure path and the end-of-stream terminator.
- **A compressed Connect frame is no longer a silently empty answer.** Each
  Connect envelope has a flags byte whose low bit marks the message compressed,
  and the client ignored it: the frame went to the protobuf decoder, which is
  not being handed protobuf, and the turn ended with no text and no tool calls
  or with a wire-type error naming nothing anyone could act on. The client now
  asks for `connect-accept-encoding: identity` on both call shapes and, if a
  frame arrives compressed regardless, fails with a named
  `devin_compressed_frame` (501) instead of guessing — including on the
  end-of-stream terminator, where a compressed frame would otherwise have read
  as the empty `{}` that means the turn succeeded. Decompression is deliberately
  not implemented: no maintainer can reach Cascade to test it, and a compliant
  server has no reason to compress once it has been told identity.

- **Grok OAuth no longer loses late or custom tool calls.** The forwarder now
  accepts `function_call` and `custom_tool_call` items that first appear in
  `response.output_item.done`, restores final arguments when argument deltas
  are absent, joins repeated SSE `data:` fields, and consumes the final event
  even when the upstream omits its trailing blank line. Streaming remains live
  while the upstream turn is running.

- **Curated models were filed at 131072 tokens however big they actually
  were, and the million-token ones compacted on every turn.** Curation stored
  one conservative window for every model it added, so a model OpenRouter
  advertises at 1,050,000 was told to auto-compact at 110,000 — eight times
  below its real capacity. That is not a cosmetic understatement: when a
  provider answers with `prompt_tokens: 0` the router substitutes an estimate
  of the prompt it just sent, and that estimate errs high on purpose, so
  against a threshold this low it landed above the compaction limit turn after
  turn. The session summarized itself, lost its working state, redid the same
  opening work, and summarized again without ever finishing (#266). The
  provider's catalog already carries the answer, so discovery now reads it:
  `context_length`, the figure the serving endpoint reports under
  `top_provider`, `context_window`, or Copilot's
  `capabilities.limits.max_context_window_tokens`, taking the smallest of the
  ones present because those are limits at different scopes and only the
  narrowest is the one the request path can rely on. Both curation forms store
  it, and `autoCompact` follows from it; the interactive prompt offers it as
  the default rather than making the user retype a number the provider already
  published. A model the catalog sizes in silence still falls back to 131072,
  and an entry curated earlier keeps what it was given — an additive run never
  rewrites metadata a user may have tuned by hand, so repair it in
  `user-models.json` or `--remove` and curate it again.

- **The substituted prompt-token estimate charged the session for reasoning no
  model ever reads.** When a provider answers with `prompt_tokens: 0` the
  router substitutes an estimate of the prompt it just sent, dividing the
  serialized request body by 3.3 bytes per token. That divisor is calibrated
  against text a model reads, and the body is not: most of a Codex turn is
  `encrypted_content`, the sealed chain of thought carried on every reasoning
  item. The gateway's Responses-to-chat bridge drops reasoning items outright
  and no routed provider can decrypt another vendor's token, so those bytes buy
  zero prompt tokens — but they were counted, and there can be a lot of them.
  The router already sheds some: a reasoning item that carries summary text and
  sits immediately before the turn it belongs to is rewritten into assistant
  text, ciphertext and all. An item with an empty summary, which is what a
  provider returns when it has none to give, is forwarded whole. Measured
  through the router itself on a twelve-turn tool loop: with summaries no
  ciphertext reaches the gateway at all, and without them every blob does and
  they are 64% of the body the router sends. Charging that 64% at 3.3 bytes per
  token is where the field reports of 3.9x–4.7x come from, and an estimate that
  high clears `autoCompact` on a window the session is nowhere near, so it
  compacted on every turn the provider reported as zero (#266). The
  estimate now discounts `encrypted_content` and counts everything else. The
  subtraction is deliberately one-sided: an unrecognized field is still counted,
  so a body shape nobody anticipated errs high rather than estimating near zero,
  and JSON escaping, structural scaffolding, and base64 image data all stay on
  the bill for the same reason. The clamp to the declared context window is
  unchanged, but it now means something. It used to fire on conversations at a
  quarter of the limit, and since `autoCompact` is 85% of the window a clamped
  estimate compacts by construction. Counting only model-visible bytes puts a
  floor under it: the estimate can only reach the window if the visible text
  does, so a clamped estimate now means the conversation really is between 82.5%
  and 100% of the limit, where compacting is the right answer.
- **A subagent on a thinking model poisoned the conversation that spawned it.**
  Every request after the child finished came back as a 400 reading "The
  `reasoning_content` in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API",
  seen on DeepSeek V4 Flash through the opencode Go subscription. LiteLLM's
  Responses-to-chat translation drops `reasoning` input items outright, and the
  carry that compensates for that only recognised a tool loop — reasoning
  sitting immediately before a `function_call`. A subagent ends in prose, so
  the reasoning behind its final answer was thrown away and the provider was
  asked to continue a thinking turn it had never been shown. The carry now
  covers every assistant turn: prose answers and custom tool calls as well as
  function calls, and the whole run of reasoning items a turn emits rather than
  only the last of them. It merges into the assistant message instead of
  inserting a second one, because two assistant turns back to back are their
  own rejection on the same providers. "Compact old tool results" was reported
  alongside this and is not involved — the aging pass only ever rewrites the
  `output` of a tool result, and now has a test proving the reasoning and
  assistant turns around it come through by reference. A subagent is not
  required to reach this: an ordinary follow-up after any thinking-mode answer
  fails the same way on a build that predates the fix, and that plainest path
  is pinned by its own test.
- **A single bad upstream response could take the whole router down.** LiteLLM
  1.96.0 raises out of its own request handler while mapping an upstream 429 —
  opencode Zen's exhausted free tier is one reliable way to reach it — and the
  gateway process ends with exit code 1. The service raced every child's exit,
  so that one failed request also killed the router and all three forwarders,
  and from then on every client got a bare `Connection error` naming nothing
  (#261). The gateway is now supervised: it is restarted in place, with a
  doubling backoff and at most five restarts inside ten minutes, while the
  router keeps listening — so a crash costs one stalled request instead of the
  session, and the next one is answered by a live gateway. Every crash, every
  restart, and the decision to stop restarting are logged unconditionally, and
  when the bound is exhausted the service exits exactly as before so the OS
  supervisor performs a clean restart. Supervision starts only once the gateway
  has been healthy: a gateway that never came up is still a startup failure, not
  a retry loop. `/health` now names which local service is unreachable, so
  doctor reports "serving but reports gateway unreachable" instead of "not
  ready", and `CODEX_ROUTER_GATEWAY_RESTARTS=0` restores the old behaviour for
  an investigation that wants the process to die where it died. The pinned
  litellm version is unchanged: a router that survives its gateway is worth
  having whichever version is installed.

  Startup also stopped refusing a Windows batch launcher. Node has declined to
  spawn a `.cmd`/`.bat` without a shell since CVE-2024-27980, so pointing
  `MODEL_ROUTER_LITELLM_BIN` at a batch wrapper ended the service before it
  spawned anything, with an `EINVAL` naming neither the file nor the reason.
  The launcher now goes through the same `spawnableCommand` helper every other
  external command in the repository uses. The shipped installer produces
  `litellm.exe`, so a normal Windows install is unaffected.
- **Command Code was unusable on every plan but one, which is not the plan most
  of its customers buy.** The provider only ever spoke `/provider/v1`, and that
  surface is an entitlement rather than a credential: a $1 Go account signs in,
  mints a real key, runs the official CLI all day, and is still answered `403
  upgrade_required` — "Your Go plan doesn't include API access". The router's
  only response was a plan note explaining why nothing worked. The `command-code`
  CLI itself does not use that surface; every turn it takes goes to
  `/alpha/generate`, which is not plan-gated. The forwarder now answers the
  entitlement refusal by moving the turn there, so Go, GOAT, Pro, and Max are
  served with the same key, the same catalog, and no upgrade. Both protocols are
  covered: the chat-completions catalog and the Messages variant that carries the
  Claude models. The refusal is remembered against a fingerprint of the
  credential — never the key — so it is bought once rather than once per turn,
  re-probed when the key changes, and re-checked every six hours in case the plan
  did. Only a real `upgrade_required` may move a turn; a timeout, a 500, or any
  other 403 is relayed with the provider's own message, because reading one of
  those as a refusal would quietly move a paying Provider-plan account onto its
  coding-plan credits. The fallback happens before the first relayed byte, the
  same boundary the upstream-retry and model-failover rules draw.

  That route carries the CLI's own envelope, not an OpenAI or Anthropic body, so
  both directions are translated: a schema-strict `config` block where every
  field is required and `memory` is a string rather than an object, messages in
  the Vercel AI SDK `ModelMessage` schema, snake_case `input_schema` tools, and a
  newline-delimited JSON response — despite its `text/event-stream` content type
  — whose blocks interleave and whose trailing `tool-call` event keys on
  `toolCallId` where every incremental event keys on `id`. Command Code publishes
  no reference for any of it; the shapes were derived from the shipped CLI bundle
  (v1.14.1) and confirmed against the live gateway.

  One measurement changed the design. An empty `system` field is not "no system
  prompt" to that route — it is a cue to splice in the Command Code agent's own
  preamble. The same one-line turn cost 92 prompt tokens with a system prompt and
  7,637 without, spent telling the model it was a different product with
  different tools. A turn carrying no system prompt of its own now gets a neutral
  one instead of the agent's.

- **The tray showed Command Code's spending windows but not what was left to
  spend.** The billing route it already polls reports the credit pool beside the
  5-hour and weekly caps, and a coding plan runs out of the first long before it
  stops hitting the second. Plan, purchased, and free credits now surface as a
  balance metric, and the plan's own low-credit threshold marks it unavailable.
- **Retained tool results had no way to be seen and no way to be cleared.**
  Tool-result compaction parks the exact original bytes of a result it rewrote
  in `<state dir>/retained-tool-results`. That store is bounded and fails safe —
  at its cap it stops accepting new results and eligible results pass through
  uncompacted — but it has no eviction and no TTL, so the only way to empty it
  was `rm -rf`, and the first time most operators would learn it existed was
  while hunting disk usage. It also matters more than its byte count: tool
  results carry file contents, command output, and API responses, and this is
  the one place the router keeps model-visible *content* on disk rather than the
  counts and bytes its telemetry is limited to.

  `./bin/doctor` now reports the store on every run — file count, total size,
  and the age of the oldest entry — and reports it whether or not the directory
  exists, because "nothing retained" is the answer most installs should see and
  seeing it is what makes the directory discoverable at all. A store parked at
  its cap is reported as a warning rather than as healthy, since that state is
  permanent until somebody empties it.

  `./bin/control tool-result-aging purge` empties it. It is a report by default:
  without `--yes` it prints what it would remove and removes nothing, and
  `--dry-run` says the same thing explicitly and outranks `--yes` so a wrapper
  that always consents can still preview. Deletion is confined to the store by
  construction rather than by intent — only names retention itself produces,
  only entries whose parent resolves to that one directory, no recursion, and no
  symlink is followed or removed. Anything else that ends up in there is left in
  place and named. The directory itself is kept: emptying it is the whole job,
  and removing it under a concurrent write buys nothing.

- **Devin's models are reachable from the session its CLI already stored, and
  this adds the provider that reaches them — untested against a real account.**
  `devin auth login` writes a persistent token to `credentials.toml`, so
  `devin-cli` reuses it exactly as `kimi-oauth` and `grok-oauth` reuse theirs.
  The transport is the part with no precedent here: Cognition publishes a
  session API, not a chat API, and the models answer only on Cascade —
  `exa.api_server_pb.ApiServerService` over Connect RPC — so this ships a small
  protobuf wire codec, the message subset transcribed from the descriptor set
  embedded in the shipped `devin` binary, a Connect streaming client, and a
  forwarder translating OpenAI Chat Completions into a `GetChatMessage` turn
  and its deltas back. Reasoning and tool calls are mapped; images ride only on
  the current turn, because replaying an older one fails the whole request.
  Thirty-seven tests cover the codec against hand-computed bytes, the request
  mapping, the credential reader, and envelope framing including a split frame
  and an error carried in the end-of-stream terminator. None of that proves
  Cascade accepts the request: no maintainer holds a Devin account, so the
  provider ships catalog-only with no checked-in models and is documented as
  unverified. `bin/devin-probe` is the way to find out — it checks the
  credential and lists the account's models for free, and `--live --tools`
  spends one turn to prove a streamed answer and a forced tool call.

  Nobody who has not asked for Devin pays anything for it being here. The
  forwarder is spawned only when the registry actually holds a `devin-cli`
  model, so an install that never ran `bin/curate-models devin-cli` starts no
  fourth child, binds no fourth port, and waits on no fourth health probe —
  startup is byte-for-byte the work it was before. The gate is the curated
  model rather than the stored credential on purpose: a curated model is
  precisely what puts a `DEVIN_CLI_FORWARD_BASE_URL` route in the generated
  gateway config, and the route and the listener are decided from the same
  model list on the same boot, so a live route can never point at a port
  nothing is listening on. Gating on `credentials.toml` would have been the
  wrong trade — someone who curated a model but has not run `devin auth login`
  gets a 401 naming that command, which a missing forwarder would have turned
  into a bare connection error. When Devin *is* routed, everything is as
  before: the forwarder is health-waited alongside the other three, an
  unbindable port still aborts startup naming the forwarder, and a forwarder
  that dies still ends the service so the OS supervisor rebuilds it.
- **A retained tool result kept forever was an archive nobody chose.** The store
  had a cap but no lifetime, so bytes retained today were still on disk a year
  from now, and a store that reached 512 files or 512 MiB stopped retaining
  anything new permanently — until somebody noticed and emptied it by hand.
  Retained originals now expire after **7 days**.

  The number is derived rather than round. Nothing ever reads those bytes back
  into a turn: the receipt tells the model to repeat the tool call, so a
  retained original's only reader is the operator, forensically, and only while
  the session that produced it still matters. The caps say the same thing about
  intent — 512 files and 512 MiB against a 32 KiB compaction floor is a working
  set of a few long sessions, not a history. And a week is already this
  repository's horizon for "recent enough to still act on", in the catalog's
  announce window and the vision host's size cache alike.

  Nothing sweeps on a timer and nothing is added to startup. Entries expire when
  the store is next written to — the way the cooldown store is trimmed on its
  next write, and the way a provider cooldown reads as gone long before anything
  deletes it. `./bin/doctor` therefore reports what has already aged out rather
  than what has been removed, and `./bin/control tool-result-aging purge
  --expired` runs that sweep by hand for an install where compaction is off and
  nothing is going to write again. It carries the same `--yes` consent, the same
  `--dry-run`, and the same containment as a full purge, and it never removes
  the key that binds the store's names to the install — expiring that would
  orphan the entries the TTL just decided to keep.

  `./bin/control tool-result-aging ttl <days|off|default>` sets the lifetime.
  `off` is a real answer, kept verbatim: an operator who wants the archive keeps
  it, and no later default overwrites that. A state file written before the TTL
  existed never answered the question, so it reads as the default rather than as
  "keep them forever". The `CODEX_ROUTER_TOOL_RESULT_AGING=0` kill switch does
  not disable expiry — it stops the router rewriting request context, and expiry
  is disk hygiene for bytes that are already written.

- **Every turn against a Meta model failed on the web search tool.** Meta's
  Responses surface answered each one with a 400 reading
  "`tools[].search_content_types` is only supported for web_search_preview
  tools", so Muse Spark 1.1, 1.2, and 1.2 Contributor were unusable rather than
  degraded — the tool is declared on the turn whenever web search is enabled,
  so this had nothing to do with whether the model actually searched. Codex
  sends the current spelling of
  that tool (`type: "web_search"`, carrying `search_content_types` beside
  `external_web_access`, `filters`, and `user_location`); Meta validates it
  against the legacy `web_search_preview` schema, which is the one place it
  accepts the field. The forwarder now drops `search_content_types` from a Meta
  request, and nothing else: the search tool itself still reaches the model with
  the rest of its settings, and a caller that sends Meta a real
  `web_search_preview` tool keeps the field on it. Scoped to Meta on purpose —
  OpenAI documents `search_content_types` on `web_search` and not on
  `web_search_preview`, the reverse of what this endpoint enforces, so the other
  Responses-native providers keep a parameter the current spec grants them.
  (#286)

- **The free Qwen3.8 endpoint refused any conversation whose system message
  arrived late or twice.** Its chat template answers those with a 400 reading
  "System message must be at the beginning", and a real Codex session reaches
  that shape routinely — a second system message, or one appended after the
  conversation is already under way. Probing the live endpoint pinned the rule
  to at most one `system` message sitting ahead of the first user, assistant, or
  tool turn; the `developer` role is outside it entirely, so
  `[developer, system, user]` is accepted and "the beginning" means before the
  first turn rather than index 0. The request profile now coalesces the system
  messages into one and places it ahead of the first turn, handling both plain
  string content and content-parts arrays, and leaves developer messages exactly
  where they are. A conversation the rule already allows is forwarded unchanged.
  Hoisting is a compatibility repair with a real cost — instructions the caller
  placed mid-conversation are read as opening context instead — accepted only
  because the alternative from this endpoint is no answer at all.

- **Every compaction against the free Qwen3.8 endpoint failed on an empty tool
  list.** Compaction disables tool use by sending `tools: []`, which every other
  forwarder reads as "no tools" — this endpoint's vLLM build answers it with a
  400 saying the array must not be empty and the field should be omitted
  instead, and answers the tool choice sent alongside it with a second 400
  saying `tools` must be set. The model carries a 262K window that auto-compacts
  at 230K, so the failure was not an edge case: it was every long session. The
  request profile now omits an empty list and then drops the tool choice that
  strip leaves with nothing to choose from. The repair sits at the last hop
  before this one endpoint, because an empty tool list stays the correct way to
  disable tools everywhere else, and a real tool list still forwards untouched.

  The entry is also renamed to **Qwen3.8-27-free-victor**, crediting `victor`,
  who publishes the endpoint, in the name the picker shows rather than only in
  the endpoint note.
- **A turn whose provider has run out of usage now continues on another model.**
  An install with thirty providers configured runs out of one of them most days:
  a coding-plan window closes, a weekly quota lands, a balance empties. The
  router named that failure clearly and then stopped — Codex has nothing to do
  with a billing error, so a session mid-task simply ended, subagents included,
  while every other model the operator could reach sat unused. The turn is now
  rebuilt for the next eligible model and sent again, and the client sees one
  clean answer.

  What qualifies is deliberately narrow: an exhausted balance or plan limit, a
  402, or a 429 whose `Retry-After` is longer than a minute. A rejected
  credential, an unknown model, a malformed request, and every 5xx keep exactly
  the error they returned before — swapping models to dodge a bad key would hide
  the one fact that fixes it, and a short rate limit is cheaper to wait out than
  a cold prompt cache is to pay for. Free models are tried before paid ones,
  then the rest in the registry's own preference order; a model on your own
  machine is never chosen automatically, because the runtime might not be
  running. A candidate whose context window cannot hold the conversation is
  skipped, so a quota failure is never traded for a context-window rejection.

  When a provider says when it will be back, that window is believed: the next
  turn skips it outright instead of buying the same rejection again, and it is
  used again by itself once the window passes or the next time it answers. A
  reset time is never invented, only ever read from the provider, and it is
  capped at six hours so a malformed one cannot strand a model.

  Nothing about the swap is silent, and nothing is injected into the transcript.
  The router logs it (never gated on `CODEX_ROUTER_QUIET`), the tray Island names
  the model actually answering, and the usage event carries `failoverFrom` so a
  rescued turn stays distinguishable from one that never failed. Compaction gets
  the same treatment, because a compaction that fails ends a session just as
  hard. `./bin/control failover status|on|off|chain <slugs>|auto|reset`; the
  doctor reports any provider currently being held off and when it clears.

- **The GLM-5.3 1M entry routed to a model code Z.ai does not serve.** Shipping
  `glm-5.3[1m]` took the vendor's documented 1M suffix at its word, and the
  suffix answers `1214` on both the OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic endpoints --
  every request through that entry failed, while plain `glm-5.3` on the same
  endpoint and credential succeeded. The entry is gone rather than repaired,
  because there is nothing behind it to repair. The window it was invented to
  reach turned out to be served on the plain entry all along: a 990,020-token
  prompt was accepted, so `zai-coding/glm-5.3` declares 1M and its picker
  description says so instead of directing readers to an entry that no longer
  exists. A `config.toml` still naming the removed slug has nothing to route to
  and fails at the native target; reselect the plain GLM-5.3 entry.

- **A `custom` provider whose models each name their own endpoint.** Every other
  provider owns one address, which is why "route this one model from that one
  host" has always meant inventing a whole provider for it. `custom` owns none:
  each of its models carries its own `baseUrl`, its own auth, and its own
  metadata, so one picker entry can hold a free community endpoint, a
  self-hosted server, and a paid API with a key, at once. Enabling it asks for
  nothing and it is never in the default set, because what it holds is whatever
  somebody put in it.

  Its first model is the free community Hugging Face Inference Endpoint for
  `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: no API key, 262K context, image input, tool calling, and a
  thinking budget the effort picker dials. Every capability was measured against
  the live endpoint rather than read off its model card — including the one
  divergence, that its vLLM build validates `reasoning_effort` against a literal
  set omitting the Codex ladder's `ultra`, so the request profile folds exactly
  that rung onto `max` and leaves every other tier alone. It is shared, rate
  limited per IP, and its owner says it will be retired once launch interest
  fades: a model to try, not one to depend on.

  The security rule follows the address down rather than staying at the provider.
  A `custom` endpoint reached with no credential must have that address
  allowlisted in code, exactly as an anonymous provider's is — otherwise adding a
  JSON file under `config/custom/` would be enough to send prompts to any host on
  the internet with nothing to authenticate them. A keyless endpoint stays
  loopback-only, neither may declare an environment override that would walk
  around those two rules, and an endpoint's identity is derived from its model so
  one model's credential file can never be pointed at another model's secret.

- **The GLM-5.3 1M entry routed to a model code Z.ai does not serve.** Shipping
  `glm-5.3[1m]` took the vendor's documented 1M suffix at its word, and the
  suffix answers `1214` on both the OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic endpoints --
  every request through that entry failed, while plain `glm-5.3` on the same
  endpoint and credential succeeded. The entry is gone rather than repaired,
  because there is nothing behind it to repair. The window it was invented to
  reach turned out to be served on the plain entry all along: a 990,020-token
  prompt was accepted, so `zai-coding/glm-5.3` declares 1M and its picker
  description says so instead of directing readers to an entry that no longer
  exists. A `config.toml` still naming the removed slug has nothing to route to
  and fails at the native target; reselect the plain GLM-5.3 entry.

- **A free Qwen3.8-27B provider that needs no account.** `qwen38-free` routes
  the community Hugging Face Inference Endpoint for `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: no API
  key, 262K context, image input, tool calling, and a thinking budget the
  effort picker dials. It joins `opencode-free` and `kilo-free` as an anonymous
  provider, so it is never selected on anyone's behalf and never defaulted --
  `./bin/model-router codex providers enable qwen38-free` is the whole setup.
  Unlike those two it is not catalog-only: a single-model endpoint has no
  naming rule to filter by, so its one documented free ID lives in code beside
  the endpoint allowlist and the model ships with metadata verified against the
  live endpoint rather than guessed by `curate-models`. The endpoint validates
  `reasoning_effort` against a literal set that omits the Codex ladder's
  `ultra`, so its request profile folds exactly that rung onto `max` and leaves
  every other tier -- and forced tool choices, which it answers correctly --
  alone. It is shared, rate limited per IP, and its owner says it will be
  retired once launch interest fades: a model to try, not one to depend on.

- **The panel's local-model view surfaces LM Studio.** LM Studio arrived as a
  provider with exactly one door: `./bin/curate-models lmstudio` in an
  interactive terminal, while the panel's Local LLMs section read only
  `ollama list` -- so models loaded in LM Studio were invisible there and
  uncountable in its summary. The snapshot now carries an LM Studio section
  read from the server's own `/v1/models` endpoint, the panel lists what it
  serves with checkboxes, and checking one publishes it through the same
  user-model overlay the terminal writes, so neither door can strand the
  other's entries. A stopped server reads "not running" instead of the section
  vanishing, and a curated model the server no longer serves stays visible as
  such rather than lingering in the picker with no way to see why.

## 0.4.0-beta.4

- **A command that opens the browser panel.** The panel shipped with no way to
  reach it: its URL carries the caller capability, and nothing printed one, so
  "nothing to install" still meant "and no way in". `codex-router.ps1 panel`
  (`bin/panel`) opens it in the default browser. It reports the router being
  down instead of opening a page that would load empty, and prints the address
  redacted, because AGENTS.md treats the capability path as local
  authentication; `--print` is the deliberate exception and says what it is
  handing over.

- **Caller-key redaction covered only `/v1`.** `redactCallerUrl` is what keeps
  the capability out of support bundles, doctor output, and error messages, and
  it matched the API path alone -- so a panel URL, the identical secret in the
  identical position, travelled through every one of those surfaces verbatim.
  It now covers each leaf the capability guards.

- **The companion no longer requires a Rust toolchain.** Building it meant
  installing cargo, the heaviest prerequisite in the project, asked of someone
  who only wanted to see the panel; without it the install step failed and the
  machine ended up with no companion at all. `tray install` now falls back to
  the Electron shell, which needs only the Node the router install already
  required, and `codex-router.ps1 companion` selects it explicitly.
  `scripts/build-electron-companion.ps1` and its shell counterpart verify the
  runtime is actually present: npm 11 blocks install scripts by default and
  electron downloads its runtime from one, so `npm ci` exits 0 having fetched
  the package but not the binary, and the failure surfaces much later as an app
  that never starts.

- **Every single-argument Windows subcommand was unreachable.** PowerShell
  enumerates a statement's output into an assignment, so
  `$Arguments = if (...) { @(...) }` collapsed a one-element array to the
  element itself; `$Arguments[0]` then indexed a String and returned its first
  character. `codex-router.ps1 tray status` died on "Unknown tray action 's'",
  as did start, stop, restart, and uninstall. The existing tests asserted the
  script's text rather than running it, so none of them saw it.

- **`bin/` scripts were not pinned to LF.** They are the same POSIX shell
  scripts as `install.sh` without the extension, so `.gitattributes`' `*.sh`
  rule never reached them and a Windows checkout with `core.autocrlf=true`
  rewrote all 27 to CRLF, which `sh` fails on. The blobs were already LF, which
  is why POSIX installs kept working and the damage stayed invisible.

- **The companion opens in a browser, with nothing to install.** The router is
  already an HTTP server on loopback with a capability-gated path, and the UI
  is plain HTML whose entire backend surface is one function, so it now serves
  itself at `/panel` behind the same caller capability every other local
  endpoint uses. No binary, no toolchain, no packaging, no tray icon to find.
  The panel deliberately carries only the reading half of the command table:
  a browser tab is reachable by anything that learns the capability, and
  "save this API key" is not something to expose on that assumption.

- **An Electron shell, packaged.** `apps/electron` builds an installer through
  electron-builder (NSIS and zip on Windows, AppImage on Linux). It is a shell
  rather than a second application: `apps/desktop/ui` is loaded verbatim and
  every command runs through the same table, so all three surfaces -- tray,
  Electron, browser panel -- are windows onto one application. The command
  table moved to `src/desktop-commands.mjs` for exactly that reason.

- **The desktop companion is a download now, not a build.** It could be
  obtained exactly one way -- install a Rust toolchain and compile it -- which
  is a hard prerequisite for anyone who only wants to run it. CI was already
  building the Windows and Linux binaries on every run and discarding them, and
  releases shipped source archives only. Releases now attach
  `codex-router-tray-<version>-windows-x64.exe` and the Linux binary,
  checksummed in `SHA256SUMS` and covered by the same provenance attestation as
  every other asset; CI publishes the same binaries as artifacts so unreleased
  changes can be tried without a toolchain. Windows already ships the WebView2
  runtime the companion needs, so a downloaded binary just runs.

- **The Windows tray is managed the way the macOS one is.** Installing it was
  possible but nothing else was: `bin/model-router-tray` answered Windows with
  "use scripts/build-desktop-tray.ps1" and `codex-router.ps1` had no `tray`
  verb at all, so where macOS and Linux each have one command that builds the
  companion and hands it to a supervisor, Windows had two incantations and no
  way to check, restart, or remove it. `./codex-router.ps1 tray
  [install|status|start|stop|restart|uninstall]` is that command. Install
  rebuilds only when the sources moved and stamps the build, so an update no
  longer rebuilds a current companion from scratch — Windows was missing from
  the rebuild gating entirely, which meant the one platform whose tray must be
  built deliberately was also the one that never recorded having been built.
  Guided setup now runs the same command instead of repeating its steps.

- **`control apply` stopped carrying its own Windows installer invocation.** It
  reuses the checkout-installer helper that `update` already uses and that is
  unit tested, rather than a second hand-written PowerShell argument list that
  nothing covered — the follow-up asked for in the review of #186.
- **A credential-free install mode for lifecycle validation.** (#224)
  `install.sh --no-provider --no-discovery` (PowerShell: `-NoProvider
  -NoDiscovery`) installs the router idle: an explicit empty provider
  selection, no credential prompts, and a persisted discovery kill-switch
  honored by every credential reader — provider key files, the macOS
  Keychain, other CLIs' OAuth and session files, Codex's `auth.json`, and the
  `codex login status` probe all stay untouched. Codex traffic gets a local
  `503 router_idle_no_provider` instead of provider or native forwarding, the
  doctor reports the idle state at warn and exits 0, and a new `stop`
  subcommand completes the install → start → status → doctor → stop →
  uninstall loop. Re-running setup without the flags leaves idle mode. As
  part of this, an explicitly empty provider selection now passes
  `ensure-configured` as idle, which also un-breaks `bin/update` for anyone
  who had hidden their last provider by hand.
- **Uninstalling the last client integration now removes the background
  service.** Whether Codex still counted as installed was keyed on the cached
  native catalog, a file uninstall deliberately retains — so the service, its
  LaunchAgent, and its listening ports survived every codex uninstall. The
  installed-state witness is now the managed block in `config.toml`, which
  enable writes and disable removes; `bin/disable` of the last client retires
  the service too, matching what the Windows wrapper always did, and
  `bin/enable` reinstalls it on the way back.

- **Switching a model on as a subagent now researches it instead of ignoring
  it.** Only six registry-proven models could ever be spawned as native v2
  children; everything else the operator enabled was a silent no-show, and
  promoting one more meant a repository change per model per provider. Now the
  toggle is the assignment: enabling a model hands it to a detached capability
  probe (two live requests proving streaming and a forced tool call through
  the installed router), a passing model is advertised to Codex as an
  experimental subagent, and the first real child turn settles the verdict —
  the router watches its own request path for `x-openai-subagent` turns, and a
  clean completion records a durable machine-local proof while a structural
  rejection demotes the model back to v1 with the reason kept in the subagent
  snapshot. Evidence lives in the protected `multi-agent-proofs.json`; local
  settings still cannot manufacture a v2 claim, hidden or switched-off models
  stay v1 whatever evidence they carry, and `control subagents verify` re-runs
  the research explicitly.

- **A reasoning model no longer answers into thirty seconds of silence.** The
  empty-completion guard buffered every routed streaming response until it saw
  content, and reasoning deltas deliberately did not count as content. On a
  reasoning model the gap between the first reasoning delta and the first output
  token is seconds to minutes, so the guard held that entire gap and the caller
  saw nothing until the turn closed or the hold budget expired. Measured against
  `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-pro` with only this behaviour varying, the client's
  first byte moved from 30,638 ms to 517 ms; `deepseek-v4-flash` moved from
  29,409 ms to 536 ms. Both held runs parked at the 30-second budget, which is
  to say the budget decided when the caller saw anything, not the model.

  Throughput was never affected, which is why this read as a frozen turn rather
  than a slow one — and why no metric caught it. `responseStartMs` stops at
  the response headers and `firstTokenMs` fires on reasoning deltas, and the
  guard kept holding past both.

  The hold exists only to make the retry invisible, and the recorded meter
  prices it: across 19,043 routed turns it fired 168 retries, of which 17
  succeeded. Every reasoning turn paid up to thirty seconds of dead air for a
  silent rescue on roughly one routed turn in a thousand. So reasoning now ends
  the hold without settling the verdict — the stream is relayed and the guard
  keeps watching from behind it, and a turn that reasons and then produces
  nothing is still classified empty. A silent upstream has no prologue worth
  waiting for, so that case still holds every byte and still retries silently.

- **An empty turn that already reached the client is stated, not swallowed.**
  Once the prologue is on the wire the router cannot substitute a retry for it,
  so it writes an `error` event into the open stream instead of grafting a
  second response onto one the client is already reading. Codex treats that as
  retryable and reissues the turn on its own ladder, which recovers more than
  the single silent retry it replaces — verified against `codex-cli` 0.145.0
  with a stub upstream: a reasoning turn ending in an empty completion produced
  one request, no answer and no error, while the same turn ending in an `error`
  event produced two requests and an answer. Turns that end this way are
  metered as `emptyCompletionUnrepairable`, apart from the retried ones, because
  one is a failure the router absorbed and the other is one the user sees.

- **Finished subagents close without a click, even when the parent ignores the
  usage hint.** Codex 0.147 still maps a child's `FINAL_ANSWER` to Working for
  the live parent turn, and long San Francisco multi-agent parents often never
  call `interrupt_agent` despite the managed `root_agent_usage_hint_text`. The
  router now scans the request input for unfinished `FINAL_ANSWER` children and
  injects the missing `collaboration.interrupt_agent` calls into the parent
  response (stream and non-stream) before `response.completed`. This runs on
  both routed external models and native OpenAI multi-agent parents (the SF
  build path). Model-authored interrupts are left alone; only missing closes
  are added.

- **Finished subagents no longer stay Working just because the parent turn is
  still live.** Codex 0.147 records a child's `FINAL_ANSWER` as
  `subAgentActivity` `interacted` and maps that to Working until the parent
  turn ends, the user clicks into the child, or the parent calls
  `interrupt_agent`. `close_agent` is not in that v2 toolset. The managed
  `multi_agent_v2` block now ships a root usage hint that tells the parent to
  interrupt finished children, so new tasks settle the badge without a click.

- **GLM-5.3, on every route that actually serves it.** Z.ai shipped GLM-5.3 on
  2026-08-14. It is now in the picker three ways: `zai-coding/glm-5.3` on the
  GLM Coding Plan subscription, `zai-api/glm-5.3` on the metered platform, and
  `opencode-go/glm-5.3` on the opencode Go subscription, whose catalog already
  advertises it (`./bin/discover-models opencode-go`). Command Code, Qwen Plan,
  Ollama Cloud, and ClinePass do not carry it yet, so nothing was added there.

  Z.ai documents the 1M context window for GLM-5.3 only behind the `[1m]` model
  suffix, so that is a separate entry — `zai-coding/glm-5.3-1m`, which sends
  `glm-5.3[1m]` and a one-million-token compaction window. The suffix-free
  entries stay at the 200K lineage default rather than inheriting GLM-5.2's 1M,
  because under-declaring a context window compacts early and over-declaring
  overruns the turn.

- **A Z.ai key now means one of two different things, and the router keeps them
  apart.** `zai-api` is a new provider for the metered open platform on
  `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4`, carrying GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2 (1M context), and
  the cheaper GLM-4.7. It ships GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.2 with the same reasoning
  ladders as the plan route, and GLM-4.7 with none, because Z.ai documents no
  effort control for it.

  It is a separate credential end to end: its own key file
  (`zai-api-key.secret`), its own keychain service, and its own environment
  variable (`ZAI_PLATFORM_API_KEY`) — never the plan's `ZAI_API_KEY`. A Coding
  Plan key is not billable on the metered endpoint and vice versa, so a
  `planNote` says so wherever a key is connected, and the account panel links
  the billing page instead of polling the plan quota route with a key that has
  no plan behind it.

- **GLM reasoning effort follows the model, not the vendor.** The `glm-thinking`
  request profile mapped every multi-tier GLM onto GLM-5.2's two rungs
  (high/max), which would have silently rounded GLM-5.3's new `low` tier up to
  `high` and billed deeper thinking than was asked for. The requested effort is
  now clamped onto the ladder each model's own registry entry declares.

- **DeepSeek Harness can use the Codex models you are already signed in to.**
  Native GPT traffic is authorized by the caller's own ChatGPT session — the
  router copies `authorization` and `chatgpt-account-id` off each request, Codex
  attaches both, and a harness turn attaches neither. So the eight native models
  were withheld from the harness: advertising them would have offered a turn
  that could not authenticate.

  The router now falls back to the session this machine is already signed in
  with. You are logged in to Codex here; a client running as the same user on
  the same machine should not have to log in again. The eight `gpt-5.6-*` and
  `gpt-5.x` models publish to the harness whenever that session is usable, and
  are withheld the moment it is not, so the picker never offers a model that
  would 401.

  It is a fallback and never an override: the injection happens only for a
  request that carried no credential of its own, so a Codex turn is unchanged —
  verified by relaying a deliberately invalid token and getting that token's own
  401 back instead of a success. The credential is never logged, never returned
  by a status call, and never put in an error message.

  The session is checked for life, not just presence. That access token lasts
  about ten days and Codex renews it only when Codex is used, so a harness-only
  stretch longer than that would have left the router sending a dead token. An
  expired session is declined two minutes early, native models stop being
  published while it is dead, and `doctor` gains a line saying to open Codex
  once — which is the fix, and which nothing else would have told anybody.
  Renewal is left to Codex: reproducing that OAuth exchange would mean guessing
  an unpublished client identity and risking the very login this was asked not
  to disturb.

  Worth knowing before leaving it on: it widens what the caller key reaches,
  from the API-key providers to the ChatGPT subscription as well.
  `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_SESSION_FALLBACK=0` turns it off, and the harness drops
  back to routed models only.

- **The tray can install DeepSeek Harness, not just publish into one.**
  `--target dsh` wrote routed models into a harness the user had already
  installed themselves; on a machine without one, the missing step was an
  `npm install -g` mentioned in passing in the docs. A Settings row now installs
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh` and publishes in one click, and `control harness
  status|setup` does the same from a terminal.

  Global rather than the `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web` the harness's README
  documents: npx refetches on every run, leaves no `dsh` to type again, and is
  invisible to the presence rule that keeps the router up for clients it cannot
  watch. Node is checked against the harness's floor before npm is reached,
  since the package declares no `engines` and a stale runtime otherwise fails at
  first boot with a syntax error from inside `node_modules`. Install and publish
  are ordered but not transactional — a failed publish leaves an installed
  harness, which is where a retry wants to start, and republishing is
  byte-identical. The npm mechanics move to `src/npm-global-install.mjs`, shared
  with the provider-CLI installs rather than copied.

  It is never a side effect: no `apply`, `enable`, or repair path installs the
  harness. The model count the button reports is the routable set, not the
  picker — native GPT models come and go with the Codex session described
  above.

  The row then runs the harness's browser UI: **Install**, then **Connect**,
  then a play button, then **Open site**, each shown only in the state it
  applies to. Publishing models and leaving somebody to remember a command and a
  port was the step this action existed to remove, so the play button starts the
  UI and the row reports the URL it is serving. Setup itself deliberately does
  not start anything — it already installs a package and writes another
  program's configuration, and a republish should not put a browser window on
  screen nobody asked for.

  A running server this router did not start is adopted rather than collided
  with — the harness binds a fixed port, so a second launch exits with
  `EADDRINUSE` — and only a process this router started is ever signalled,
  matched on PID *and* process start identity because PIDs are reused.

  It can also be turned off again, which it could not safely be before.
  `bin/model-router dsh disable` ran `service.mjs uninstall` unconditionally, so
  switching the harness off removed the LaunchAgent and stopped Codex working
  too — the service is one shared plane, and one client leaving is not a reason
  to retire it. `bin/disable` now removes it only once no client integration
  remains, and the tray's **Turn off** goes through `control harness disconnect`,
  which stops a UI this router started, removes the route, and touches nothing
  else: the CLI, the harness's own settings, its other providers, and the
  service all stay.

  Two ways the uninstall could damage a user's own configuration are fixed with
  it. Restoring the default model overwrote whatever was there with the snapshot
  taken at install — so a model chosen afterwards through the harness's own
  Models page was silently discarded; the restore now applies only over a
  default this router wrote. And with no snapshot left to restore, a
  router-owned default was left in place pointing at the provider the same
  uninstall had just removed; it is now taken out.


- **A client the tray cannot watch keeps the router running.** The tray's
  presence setting could tie the router to the Codex and ChatGPT desktop apps
  and stop it 30 seconds after both closed. `NSRunningApplication` enumerates
  app bundles and nothing else, so that setting could only ever see those two:
  a `codex` TUI in a terminal and a `dsh` harness turn are both invisible to it.
  Neither can be started on demand either — a turn that finds 127.0.0.1:4202
  closed fails at once, while the stack behind that port takes up to 300 seconds
  to warm — so a terminal user who tried the setting got a dead port and a
  `doctor` line telling them to open an app they may not use.

  `effectivePresenceMode()` now reports `always` whenever the harness route is
  published or `codex` resolves on PATH, and the tray and `doctor` both act on
  that instead of the raw mode. Detection errs toward finding a client: a false
  positive costs a dormant toggle, a false negative costs somebody their next
  request. The stored preference is overridden rather than rewritten, so
  removing the client restores the user's own choice. `control --json` now
  carries a `presence` block so the router owns the rule and the tray consumes
  it rather than re-deriving it, and the tray picks up a change on the snapshot
  it already polls.

- **DeepSeek Harness is a supported target.** `--target dsh` publishes every
  routed model into the harness's own `settings.yaml` as one provider route,
  keyed to the same `/v1/responses` endpoint Codex already uses — so a harness
  turn gets the router's tool-result ageing, vision bridge, prompt-token
  substitution, bounded upstream retries, and tokens-per-second accounting
  without a second request path. The harness's shipped bundle mounts
  `dsh-llm-pi-ai` dormant and hot-reloads its settings document, so this is a
  settings write rather than a plugin change and there is nothing to restart.
  A target is a *client*, not a router: both share one service, one gateway,
  one credential store, and one provider selection, so adding the second
  integration never asks for a key again, and any change to the routable set
  republishes whichever clients are installed rather than letting the two
  drift apart.

  The router owns exactly one key in each of the harness's two documents
  (`llm-pi-ai.providers.codex-router` and `CODEX_ROUTER_CALLER_KEY`) and treats
  every other byte as somebody else's: sibling routes, other sections,
  comments, and other credentials survive a publish, and `dsh disable` restores
  the document. A settings file the new fail-closed YAML lexer cannot read
  unambiguously — a tab indent, a duplicate key, a multi-document stream, an
  inline `providers` mapping — is refused with the file untouched and the line
  named, rather than rewritten on a guess. Both documents are written 0600, the
  same bound the harness holds them to, because the settings document carries
  the managed base URL and the other carries the key it references.

  Only selected, credentialed, listed, non-hidden routed models are published.
  Native GPT models are not: they need the caller's own ChatGPT session, which
  a harness request does not carry, so advertising them would offer a turn that
  cannot authenticate — the same reason the vision-bridge engine candidates
  exclude them here. Taking over the harness's default model is opt-in,
  snapshotted, and reversible; delegation stays the user's, since
  `dsh-tool-subagent` is composition rather than settings and
  `./bin/model-router dsh subagent-preset` hands over the block to paste
  instead of editing a preset the router does not own.

- **`src/skills-install.mjs` no longer hijacks an unrelated `install`.** Its
  CLI block ran on `process.argv[2]` alone with no entry-module guard, and
  `install-manifest.mjs` imports it — so any command that transitively pulled
  the manifest in while its own subcommand happened to be `install` or
  `uninstall` installed the Codex skill pack and exited 0 before doing its own
  work. Every other module in the repository already guarded this; this one
  now does too.

- **Command Code's catalog caught up, and one dead route fixed.** The Messages
  route advertised Haiku 4.5 as `claude-haiku-4-5`, the undated alias every
  other Anthropic surface accepts. Command Code's catalog does not carry it —
  only the dated `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — so that route could never have
  resolved, and it was the one registered id in either reseller family absent
  from the live `/models` list. A registry assertion now pins the dated id.

  Fourteen models Command Code serves and the registry did not are now checked
  in: `grok-4.6`, `claude-opus-5`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`,
  `gemini-3.7-flash`, `GLM-5.2-Fast`, `Kimi-K2.7-Code-Highspeed`,
  `Qwen3.7-Flash`, and first entries for five vendors the reseller added since
  the last sweep — `meta/muse-spark-1.2`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra`,
  `sakana/fugu-ultra`, `thinkingmachines/inkling` and `inkling-small`, and
  `poolside/laguna-s-2.1`. Context windows come from Command Code's own
  `/models` payload rather than the model name; effort ladders, image support,
  and request profiles mirror the already shipped sibling of the same upstream
  line, or fall back to the conservative single-`high` floor for a vendor with
  no prior entry. Older point releases the catalog still lists behind a
  registered newer sibling (GLM-5/5.1, Kimi K2.5/K2.6, MiniMax-M2.5,
  Qwen3.6, Step-3.5, gemini-3.1/3.5-flash-lite, gpt-5.3/5.4, mimo-v2.5) stay
  out deliberately; `bin/curate-models commandcode` still reaches them per
  user.

  These fourteen route correctly — a live request reaches Command Code and
  comes back with the account's own plan verdict — but their capability
  metadata is **not** live-verified: the test account is on the Go plan, which
  answers every Provider API call with "Your Go plan doesn't include API
  access." That blocks the tool-calling, streaming, and compaction probes for
  the twenty-one models already shipped just as much as for the new ones. Run
  `./bin/test-model 'commandcode/SLUG' --live --yes` on a Provider-plan account
  before treating any of them as proven.

  opencode Go needed no additions. All seven ids its catalog lists and the
  registry omits (`glm-5`, `kimi-k2.5`, `minimax-m2.5`, `qwen3.5-plus`,
  `mimo-v2-pro`, `mimo-v2-omni`, `hy3-preview`) are older releases or preview
  channels of models already registered, and every registered opencode Go id
  is still live.

- **Windows installs the tray companion, and keeps it.** Nothing on Windows
  ever built or started it: `install.ps1` had no tray option at all, the
  installer's own decision helper excluded the platform outright, and
  `control tray enable` answered `{"supported":false}` and exited 0 — a silent
  no-op that reads as success while no tray was ever going to appear. The only
  route was knowing to run `scripts/build-desktop-tray.ps1` by hand, and even
  then the companion vanished at the next reboot. `install.ps1 -WithTray` (and
  `-NoTray`, matching `install.sh`) now builds it and registers a `Codex Router
  Tray` logon task, kept separate from the router's own task so stopping one
  never takes the other down. Quitting from the tray menu stays quit: the
  restart setting covers a crash, not a clean exit. A platform with no
  supervisor now says so on stderr rather than reporting success, and the
  guidance names the `^` overflow that hides new tray icons on Windows 11.

- **Windows stops mistaking its own spawn failures for provider problems.** A
  command resolved on Windows and a command Windows can spawn are two different
  things: `where.exe` lists the extensionless npm shim first, and Node has
  refused to run a `.cmd` shim without a shell since CVE-2024-27980. Four
  copies of the same lookup helper took line one anyway, and the spawn errors
  that followed were each read as something else. The official Grok CLI was the
  worst of it — a healthy npm install failed to launch, raising the same
  `spawn UNKNOWN` that Smart App Control raises, so the router announced that
  Windows application control had blocked it and told the operator to give up
  on OAuth and use an API key. Even had the preflight passed, the token refresh
  behind it spawned the shim the same unusable way.

  Resolution and launching now live in one module and are used everywhere:
  the routed-subagent proof run (which hands Codex a whole sentence, so it
  cannot go through a shell that joins arguments on spaces), the Codex account
  usage panel, the doctor's Codex configuration probe, the `npm install -g` and
  sign-in paths for provider CLIs, and the precedence probe. Arguments are
  escaped for `cmd.exe` rather than concatenated, so a path under
  `C:\Program Files` and a prompt containing spaces both survive.

- **Three more Windows-only breakages in the same family.** The Codex account
  usage panel kept a private two-line search for the CLI — an undocumented
  environment variable, a macOS-only path, then the bare name — which finds
  nothing on Windows, so the panel reported "the Codex app-server could not be
  started" on every machine; it now uses the shared discovery and kills the
  process tree rather than leaking a Codex process per poll. `control apply`
  ran the POSIX `bin/enable` script, which Windows cannot execute, and now
  takes the PowerShell installer that `doctor --fix` already uses. The
  vision-model download worker was the one detached child without
  `windowsHide`, so it opened a console window for the length of a
  multi-gigabyte pull.

- **A local Ollama the router could find is one it can also run.** The vision
  host probed for Ollama through the runtime's known install locations but then
  spawned the bare name, so a Windows install under `%LOCALAPPDATA%` reported
  as available and failed at the next call. Both now use the same resolver.

- **Routed models that emit integer tool arguments as JSON floats no longer
  get those calls rejected by Codex.** Grok 4.6 was sending
  `timeout_ms: 20000.0`; Codex's native `shell_command` schema wants a `u64`,
  so every agentic turn died before the command ran. The response rewrite now
  turns whole-number tokens into integers on the way back, including native
  tools that are not namespaced. Genuine fractions are left alone.

## 0.4.0-beta.3

- **The usage panel shows what is left of your plan for xAI OAuth, MiniMax,
  Command Code, and opencode Go.** MiniMax reads its coding-plan remains
  endpoint (interval and weekly windows), Command Code reads the same billing
  credits route its official CLI polls (5-hour and weekly windows), and
  opencode Go reads its usage endpoint (rolling, weekly, and monthly windows,
  shared across the protocol variants). A fresh xAI weekly window arrives with
  its zero usage omitted from the wire format, which used to read as
  "unavailable" instead of everything left — a billing period with no percent
  now reads as 0% used. Every fetcher refuses to send the credential anywhere
  but the provider's own host, and any failure degrades to the previous
  router-traffic view.

- **The subagent list shows only models you can actually pick.** Hidden models
  rendered as permanently locked rows; they are filtered out, with a note
  giving the hidden count and pointing at the picker section that brings them
  back. Toolbar labels name the setting they change, both surfaces note that
  subagent choices never hide models from Codex's picker, and the tray's two
  look-alike provider panels no longer expand in lockstep.

- **A failed request names its cause all the way down.** The transport reports
  every connection-level failure as a bare `TypeError: fetch failed` with the
  code that says why buried on the cause chain, which left repeated native
  failures unexplainable from the retained log. The router and every forwarder
  now log the whole chain — names and codes only where a failure can wrap
  upstream response text. Name-resolution and local-resource failures
  (`ENOTFOUND`, `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, `ENOBUFS`) joined the retryable set, since
  all three fail before a connection exists. Every native failure now records
  a usage event, so a 502 without one can no longer hide inside the router,
  and an uncaught crash exits with its own code (95/94) and full chain in the
  log, so a supervisor's exit line alone distinguishes an in-process crash
  from an external kill.

- **One union-rooted tool schema no longer kills every xAI OAuth turn.** xAI
  rejects the whole request when any tool's parameter schema roots in an
  `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf` union, and Codex's own automation tool ships one —
  so a Grok session that never touched automations still died on its first
  message. Union roots are flattened into a single object schema (branch
  properties merged, `required` narrowed to what every branch demands) and
  object-rooted schemas pass through untouched.

- **GitHub Copilot is available as a catalog-only provider.** A
  fine-grained PAT with the Copilot Requests permission is validated through
  the Copilot account endpoint; account-selected inference hosts are restricted
  to GitHub-owned Copilot hosts, and account routing is refreshed once on a 401
  before any bytes are relayed. Live discovery exposes only
  account-visible Responses models that advertise streaming and tool calls, so
  plans and organization policy remain authoritative. Setup, doctor, both tray
  implementations, quota reporting, curation, and credential redaction all use
  the same provider path. Account discovery keeps GitHub authoritative as its
  model and inference interfaces evolve.

- **The reader is asked what you actually want to know, and asked again when
  that changes.** The question used to be pinned to the image's own message, so
  an image's reading was fixed by the first thing ever asked about it. Paste a
  photo, ask "what is this?", and a reader under orders to describe rather than
  identify answered "a lake at dusk" — after which the model went to the
  filesystem, then to reverse image search, and uploaded the screenshot to a
  public image host to get an answer the vision model could have given in a
  line. Now the newest image follows the newest question.

  It is still bought once per *question*, never once per turn, so Codex
  resending the whole conversation between turns costs nothing — and only the
  newest image follows the conversation, so a chat holding ten screenshots
  cannot turn one new question into ten new reads. Earlier readings are kept, so
  the answer to your first question is still in front of the model when you ask
  your second.

- **The reader may say what something is.** A new `## Identification` section:
  the place, product, application, chart type, or well-known image it
  recognizes, with its confidence and what in the picture supports it. It is
  the one section where inference is allowed — `## Text` stays verbatim, and an
  unrecognizable image says `(unrecognized)` rather than guessing.

- **One unreachable engine no longer costs you the image.** Resolving an engine
  and reaching it are different questions, and the bridge conflated them: a
  pinned engine that resolved and then answered 401 because a session lapsed,
  or 503 because the provider's endpoint was down, left every paste degrading
  to "could not be read" until somebody noticed. Both happened within an hour of
  testing. The reader is now a short list — your chosen engine first, then the
  other credentialed vision models — and the image is offered to the next one
  when the first cannot be reached. Verified live with a genuinely dead engine
  pinned first: all ten test images were still read.

  Nothing extra is spent when your engine works, since a second engine is only
  called after the first has failed. It is not silent: the evidence names
  whichever engine actually did the reading and the log line records the
  fallback. A pin that does not resolve at all is still an operator-visible
  problem rather than a quiet switch, and a pinned local engine never falls back
  onto a provider's quota you did not choose to spend. Another provider is tried
  before another attempt at a broken one, which cut a degraded read from 30–52s
  to 12–35s.

- **A read that fails once is asked again.** The engine is a rate-limited
  account across a network, so a 429, a 502, a reset connection, or an empty
  reply used to cost you that image for the whole turn. Those are retried twice,
  250ms then 1s. A refusal is not: 400, 401, 403 and 404 buy the identical
  refusal a second time, and a timeout is reported rather than retried, because
  the per-attempt budget is already two minutes. A local engine that is down
  still reports the transport's own words, which is how you learn your own
  server is not running.

- **The gateway no longer installs a cryptography with a known advisory.**
  litellm 1.95.0 required `cryptography>=48.0.1,<49.0`, and the fix for
  GHSA-g6cj-pr64-35w5 — a Bleichenbacher oracle reachable through PKCS#7
  EnvelopedData decryption — landed in 50.0.0, so the patched version could not
  be resolved at all while that pin was held. litellm moves to 1.96.0, which
  allows `cryptography>=49.0.0,<51.0`, and the lock now carries 50.0.0. Nothing
  else moves except `litellm-enterprise`.

  The fastapi cap stays at 0.139.2. litellm 1.96.0 declares `fastapi<1.0` but
  still imports `get_flat_dependant`, which 0.140 removed, so a resolve that
  looks clean produces a gateway that dies on startup — verified by booting the
  proxy on both pins rather than by trusting the resolver. macOS installs get
  faster as a side effect: 1.96.0 publishes macOS wheels, where 1.95.0 had to be
  built from the sdist with a Rust toolchain.

- **An image the model fetched for itself is read too.** The bridge walked user
  messages only, so a pasted screenshot was transcribed and the turn still
  failed: the paste carries the file's path as text, the text-only model
  reached for Codex's `view_image` tool on it, and the tool result came back
  holding the same megabytes of image the bridge had just paid to read. The
  provider rejected the whole conversation (`unknown variant image_url`) with
  no mention of an image. Tool results are now read on the same terms as
  messages — and for the question that led to them, so the second read of the
  same screenshot is served from the transcript cache rather than bought again.
  Text-only models can now read image files on disk as well as pastes, which
  fell out of the same fix.

- **A transcript says which file it is of, so the model stops fetching what it
  already has.** A paste carries the image and its path, and nothing connected
  the two: the model was handed a full reading and then spent a tool call and an
  entire resend of the conversation opening the file itself — far more than the
  read cost. The evidence header now names the path and says the reading is
  complete. Codex's `<image …>` wrapper is markup rather than anything you
  asked, so it no longer travels to the vision engine as part of your question.

- **One image asked one question is bought once, however many requests are in
  flight.** The transcript cache only knew about reads that had finished, so
  concurrent turns — Codex sends them, and a subagent runs beside its parent —
  all missed and all paid. Measured on a real install: one pasted screenshot,
  two overlapping reads, three seconds apart. Reads now share, and the images in
  one turn are read concurrently under a cap rather than one after another, so a
  turn with five screenshots waits for the slowest instead of the sum.

- **What the router knows about an image accumulates instead of resetting.** A
  transcript used to be filed under the question that bought it, and only that
  one was ever injected — so an image's evidence was a snapshot of the first
  thing you asked about it. Ask "what colour is this?" and a later "what does
  the text say?" got the colour-focused reading back, with no way to ever add to
  it. The record is now per image: a later read appends, and every turn sees
  everything the router has learned about that picture. Records are capped, and
  the first, general reading is never the one dropped.

  The same image appearing twice in a turn — the paste and the tool result that
  fetched it — now prints its reading once, with the second slot pointing at the
  first. That is keyed on the image itself, never on transcripts that happen to
  match, so two screenshots that read alike are still two images.

- **An image sent straight to the gateway no longer dies at the provider.** The
  API forwarder sits downstream of the gateway, so Codex's own turns arrive
  already bridged — but a client talking to the gateway directly could hand a
  text-only model an image and get back a 400 naming a JSON variant, which reads
  as a router bug. Those parts are now replaced with a stated failure that says
  where the bridge actually lives. Reading them there is deliberately not
  offered: the engine call would re-enter the gateway holding that very request.

- **An incomplete reading says so.** A transcript that came back missing its
  required sections, or truncated at the router's size limit, is labelled as
  partial — and that is the only time the model is told it can look again. Left
  unsaid, a model cannot tell "the image does not show that" from "the
  transcript does not mention it", and it answers the first with confidence
  either way.

- **A text-only model reads a pasted image with no configuration.** The vision
  bridge is now on by default: paste a screenshot into DeepSeek, GLM, or Kimi
  and it is transcribed by the cheapest vision-capable model you have already
  enabled — or by your signed-in ChatGPT plan — instead of silently doing
  nothing until you discovered a toggle. An install with nothing to read images
  with behaves exactly as it did before: no engine resolves, the picker keeps
  saying text-only, and Codex keeps refusing the paste.

  Turning it off is permanent. The state file's *presence* is what separates
  "never configured" from "configured off", so a stored `enabled: false` is
  never re-enabled by this change or any future one, and a state file this
  build cannot parse falls back to off rather than to the new default. The
  installer no longer writes bridge state at all; it only reports what will
  happen.

  Two things it will not do on its own. It never picks an engine served from
  your own machine — the pinned `local` engine, or a model from the keyless
  `local` provider — because your runtime may not be running and that would
  fail every paste; pin one and it is used gladly. And it no longer spends
  quota invisibly: every read that misses the transcript cache records a usage
  event naming the engine it was billed to, and the per-turn log line is no
  longer suppressed on an unattended service. A ChatGPT-plan engine's quota is
  still not reflected in the tray's limits.

- **A curated model can say it refuses a forced tool choice.** A few upstreams
  call tools happily when `tool_choice` is `"auto"` and answer HTTP 400 when
  one is required, so the compatibility check reported no tool support and the
  routed-subagent handoff failed on a model whose tool calling was fine. The
  vendor profiles already covered DeepSeek and Qwen on their own endpoints;
  reached through a reseller like OpenRouter the same model had nowhere to
  declare it, because those providers ship no registry models to inherit a
  profile from. Curation now asks, and stores `auto-tool-choice`
  (`--request-profile auto-tool-choice` in the `--models` form), which
  downgrades the forced choice for that model and touches no other parameter.
  It stays per model on purpose: OpenRouter reports `tool_choice` support per
  model in its own catalog, so downgrading for a whole reseller would let
  models that honor a forced choice quietly decline both the probe and the
  subagent relay's forced function call. The probe itself still sends
  `required`. Thanks to @jepgambardella for the report.

- **An upstream failure that happens before any response byte is retried once
  or twice instead of being relayed.** ChatGPT's edge intermittently answers a
  native turn with a 503 whose body is "upstream connect error or
  disconnect/reset before headers"; a live usage log recorded Cloudflare 520s
  in the same window. The 503 is upstream and still is — but "before headers"
  means nothing was ever served, so the router now sends the request again
  rather than handing Codex a 5xx and spending one of its five reconnects on a
  failure a quarter of a second would have absorbed. Two retries at 250ms and
  750ms, so a genuinely dead upstream still fails in about a second rather than
  hanging. Only the statuses that mean an intermediary never got a response
  (502, 503, 504, and Cloudflare's 520-524) and connect-level socket failures
  qualify: a 429 is relayed with its `Retry-After` intact, every 4xx is
  relayed, and a 500 is left alone because the origin ran. A retry only starts
  while the request has been cheap so far, so a 504 the edge spent half a
  minute producing is relayed rather than tried twice more. Nothing is ever
  retried once a byte has reached the caller, which would duplicate the stream.
  A caller that disconnects stops the retries immediately, including during the
  backoff. Retries are logged whether or not the service is quiet, and recorded
  on the usage event, so an upstream that is being papered over still looks
  flaky in the telemetry instead of healthy.

- **A provider that reports no prompt tokens no longer disables compaction.**
  Codex decides when to auto-compact from the `input_tokens` each response
  reports. opencode's Go endpoint stopped reporting them for its DeepSeek V4
  models, so the context counter never climbed, compaction never fired, and
  sessions ran until the provider itself refused the turn — one captured turn
  carried 1,050,034 tokens against a 1,048,576-token limit, with the context
  bar still showing nearly empty. When a routed response now explicitly claims
  zero prompt tokens for a request the router just measured as large, the
  router substitutes an estimate of the prompt it sent, so Codex compacts on
  time. The estimate errs high on purpose: compaction sits 14% below the hard
  limit, so an estimate that lands low would let the turn die anyway, while a
  high one only compacts sooner. Nothing else is touched — a provider that
  reports correctly, a response with no usage block, and native traffic all
  pass through byte for byte, and the substitution stops by itself once the
  upstream starts reporting again. It is never silent: the usage event keeps
  the provider's own counts and adds `estimatedInputTokens` beside them, and
  the turn logs `estimated-input-tokens=<count>`, so estimated turns can never
  be mistaken for the provider having recovered.

- **You can now see which local models to download.** Installing one required
  knowing its tag by heart: the tray's only entry point was a free-text field,
  and every command took a tag as an argument, so anyone who had never
  installed a local model had nowhere to start. `local-models list` and the
  tray's Local LLMs panel now offer a shortlist rated against this machine's
  memory, with tool support stated per entry — it decides whether Codex can
  drive the model at all, and several popular coding models turn out not to
  have it. Anything already downloaded drops off the list. `list` also renders
  for a person now instead of printing one long JSON line; `--json` keeps the
  machine-readable form.

- **A local model is now checked against the machine before it downloads.**
  Installing one asked whether Codex could drive it but never whether the
  machine could run it, so a 65 GB pull could finish on a laptop that can never
  load it. The registry manifest already carries the size, so the same lookup
  now also rates fit against detected memory — unified memory on Apple Silicon,
  GPU memory where NVIDIA reports it, system RAM otherwise, allowing ~20% above
  the weights for context and cache. `inspect` reports `fits`, `tight`, or
  `too-large`; `install` refuses a `too-large` model before transferring
  anything unless `--yes` overrides it, and warns on a `tight` one.

- **The doctor stopped telling the local provider to store an API key.** Its
  provider loop labelled every row "<name> key" and offered `provider-key ...
  set` as the fix — a command the keyless local provider refuses. The
  empty-picker warning also claimed a "key stored" that never existed and
  pointed at `curate-models`, which is the remote-catalog flow rather than the
  download-and-check one local models use. The row is named for the endpoint
  now, and both fixes name commands that work.

- **The macOS tray lists every provider, not just the ones already working.**
  Its Providers section built rows by grouping the models in the picker, so a
  provider shipping none had no row — hiding the local provider and all ten
  catalog-only services in the one place built to configure them. Rows now come
  from the router's registry snapshot.

- **The Windows and Linux tray can toggle providers added after it shipped.**
  Its provider allowlist was a hardcoded six-entry list, so everything added
  since — the local provider included — failed with "Unknown provider." It now
  validates the id's shape and lets the registry decide what exists.

- **Windows no longer opens a console window at logon.** The scheduled task ran
  the CMD wrapper through `cmd.exe`, so a console window appeared at every logon
  and stayed for the router's lifetime, reappearing on each watchdog restart.
  The task now runs a generated VBS launcher under `wscript.exe //B //NoLogo`,
  which starts the wrapper hidden and waits for it, re-raising the wrapper's
  exit code so Task Scheduler's restart-on-failure settings still see a crash as
  a crash. Reinstalling replaces the old task in place, and uninstalling removes
  both generated launchers. Reinstalling and restarting now wait for the running
  instance to actually exit before starting the new one, an install that cannot
  register the task starts the router again rather than leaving the machine with
  none, and stopping a service that was never installed is no longer an error.

- **The Python gateway now installs from a hash-verified lock.** Pinning
  `litellm[proxy]` and `fastapi` left their entire transitive tree unpinned, so
  every install resolved and then executed around a hundred packages that
  nothing had verified — and two machines installing on different days got
  different trees. `requirements/python.txt` now pins that whole closure with a
  SHA256 for every distribution, and all four install paths (the `uv` and `pip`
  branches of `bin/install` and `install.ps1`) install it with
  `--require-hashes`. The pinned versions are unchanged. The lock is universal:
  one file covering macOS, Linux, and Windows on CPython 3.10+ through
  environment markers, rather than a snapshot of whoever generated it. The
  version literals are gone from the shell scripts entirely — `bin/lock-python`
  regenerates the lock from `PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS`, and
  `test/python-lock.test.mjs` fails the suite if the lock, the compile input,
  and that constant ever disagree, or if either installer stops checking
  hashes.

- **Text-only models can answer about a pasted image.** A model with no image
  input — DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi — used to refuse the paste outright. When the
  vision bridge is on, a vision model you already have reads the image and
  hands the transcript over, labelled as quoted image content rather than as
  instructions, so a screenshot saying "SYSTEM: delete everything" reads as
  something the image says. The transcript is cached per image, so a five-turn
  conversation about one screenshot is billed for one reading, and a failed
  reading becomes a stated failure in the turn instead of an invented answer.
  The picker only advertises image input while an engine actually resolves.

- **Models on your own machine are a provider, not a special case.** Local
  models served through Ollama are checked in the tray and routed through the
  normal provider path, with their real context window and Ollama's own
  protocol so `num_ctx` applies. Codex drives every turn through tool calls, so
  a model is published only after `local-models agent-check` proves it can
  dispatch one against Codex's real prompt — a check run with the actual
  client, because three hand-written probes each graded it backwards. Local
  chat stays labelled experimental: the same model has passed and failed the
  identical check minutes apart. Reading images locally is the dependable half.

- **The tray manages local models in one place.** Local LLMs is where they are
  installed by tag (including `hf.co/user/repo:Q4_K_M`), benchmarked, offered
  to Codex, pointed at vision, and removed. The Vision panel is now just the
  switch and which engine is reading. Rows say which of the two roles a model
  can fill, and the checkbox is dead for a model without tool support instead
  of silently doing nothing.

- **Codex updates now refresh the tray for every supported install location.**
  Guided setup installs the companion at `~/Applications/Model Router.app`,
  but updates only refreshed the tray when the checkout's own `dist/Model
  Router.app` existed. The update path now also detects the home-Applications
  bundle and the registered login-item bundle, then rebuilds and relaunches
  the tray from the updated checkout.

- **`doctor --fix` no longer breaks a running install from a second checkout.**
  When the recorded state owner still exists, repair now runs from that
  checkout and keeps ownership there. Deliberate ownership transfer still
  requires an explicit override or a fresh install.

- **The macOS tray stays linked to the apps that launch it.** If the tray
  bundle moves (for example from a checkout on a removable volume to the
  stable install), the next launch re-registers the login item against the
  current bundle; the launcher replaces an already-running tray with the
  rebuilt bundle; and `codex update` rebuilds and relaunches an installed tray
  so a router update never leaves a stale companion behind. Update & Verify
  now updates the checkout recorded as the installation owner instead of
  whichever checkout the tray binary was built from.

- **A busy machine no longer fails startup on services that are working.**
  Each health probe was abandoned after a flat second, and a probe we gave up
  on counted exactly like a refused connection. Under the fork and exec
  contention of a login — when a build or a sync starts at the same moment as
  the router — a forwarder that had printed `listening` at 1.4 s answered every
  probe later than that, so all of them aborted, the budget ran out, and
  startup reported `Timed out waiting for API forwarder to become healthy`
  about a service that was fine. The probe window now widens from 1 s to a 10 s
  cap, and the two outcomes are told apart: nothing listening on loopback
  refuses instantly, so a refusal still backs off (a cold-starting gateway must
  not flood its own access log), while an abort is retried at once with a wider
  window, because the window it already spent is backoff enough and gives no
  evidence the service is dead. A timeout now also says which of the two it
  saw. A service that genuinely died is still reported the same way it always
  was, by the exit check between the probe and the sleep: waking that sleep from
  the child's own exit callback would report it sooner, and kills the process on
  Windows with a libuv assertion while it is reporting the failure it had
  already diagnosed correctly.

## 0.4.0-beta.2

- **Updates stop reinstalling dependencies that never changed.** Every update
  re-ran the whole installer, so a commit that touched one `.mjs` file still
  wiped `node_modules` for a fresh `npm ci` and re-resolved the entire
  `litellm[proxy]` tree against PyPI — which pulled unpinned transitive
  upgrades and, on a cold uv cache or a slow link, dominated the run. Both
  installers now fingerprint each dependency step (the lockfile for Node, the
  pinned requirement set plus the installed distribution versions for Python)
  and skip it when the artifacts already match, recording the stamp next to
  `node_modules/` and `.venv/` so deleting either one reinstalls. Repair still
  rebuilds everything: `doctor --fix` passes `--force-deps` (`-ForceDeps` on
  Windows), which fingerprints cannot know about a corrupted tree. The
  LiteLLM and FastAPI pins now live in `src/install-plan.mjs`, and a test
  fails if either installer's copy drifts.

- **`update check` no longer performs the update.** The `bin/update` wrapper
  hardcoded the `update` subcommand, so the read-only availability check was
  unreachable from the CLI and asking "is there a new version?" reinstalled
  the router instead. Both `bin/update` and `codex-router.ps1 update` now
  forward the subcommand, and a bare invocation still updates.

- **Reasoning efforts now match what the installed Codex build can display.**
  Codex's picker parses effort levels into a fixed enum and silently drops
  values it does not recognize; `max` and `ultra` only joined that enum in
  Codex 0.143.0, so on older builds the `max` tiers curated for several
  models simply vanished from the effort menu (GLM-5.2 lost its second tier,
  DeepSeek V4 Flash showed two levels instead of three). The catalog now
  derives the supported vocabulary from the installed Codex version and
  republishes out-of-range efforts at the nearest supported tier (`max` →
  `xhigh`), keeping defaults and announcement copy in range. Routing is
  unchanged — the forwarder already folds `xhigh` back to each vendor's
  documented maximum.

- **Legacy opencode Go models now offer Codex's native migration prompt.**
  GLM-5.1, Kimi K2.6, and MiniMax M2.7 carry an `upgradeTo` entry pointing at
  their generational successor on the same subscription (GLM-5.2, Kimi K3,
  MiniMax M3), so operators still running the older model get the
  full-screen "upgrade" modal and can switch their default with one accept —
  the older models stay in the picker. Upgrade targets are now validated at
  registry load: a checked-in prompt pointing at a missing or unlisted slug
  fails the build, and a user-curated one is skipped with a warning instead
  of shipping a modal that can never render.

- **New models announce themselves in Codex.** Checked-in models that newly
  become routable — shipped by a router update, or unlocked the moment their
  provider is credentialed and enabled — now carry Codex's native
  "Introducing {model}" announcement for seven days, with copy assembled from
  their verified picker metadata (context window, effort ladder, image
  input). The first catalog capture seeds the tracking state silently so an
  install never announces the whole catalog, locally curated models never
  self-announce, and Codex's own per-model show cap still applies. Curators
  can override the generated copy with an `availabilityNux` string on the
  registry entry, and a new `upgradeTo` field (`{ model, markdown }`) drives
  Codex's full-screen migration prompt for a genuine successor model —
  accepting it switches the operator's default model, so it is reserved for
  deliberate hand-offs.

- **Adapted the managed `[agents]` concurrency default to the installed Codex
  build.** Some Codex builds (observed on 0.141-0.145) parse `[agents]` as a
  pure role map and refuse to load any config containing the scalar, which
  broke `codex login status` and `codex doctor` outright. The config manager
  now probes the installed binary with a minimal config before writing the
  scalar and skips it when the build rejects it, so builds that accept the
  scalar keep the concurrency cap and strict builds keep a loadable config.
- **Re-captured the native model catalog when the Codex build changes.** The
  cached capture now records the Codex version that produced it and is
  refreshed from `codex debug models` on mismatch, so a catalog captured by an
  older build no longer feeds missing or stale capability fields (such as
  `supports_reasoning_summaries`) into the merged catalog after an upgrade. If
  the re-capture fails, the router keeps serving the previous capture and says
  so instead of failing the rebuild.

- **Reasoning effort ladders now match each vendor's documentation.** Every
  listed model's picker levels were verified against the provider's official
  API docs: Kimi K3 (API) gains its documented low/high/max ladder instead of
  a forced max; DeepSeek V4 Flash gains its real low tier; Claude Opus 4.8
  gains the full low/medium/high/xhigh/max `output_config.effort` ladder and
  the forwarder now passes the picked effort through instead of hardcoding
  high; GLM-5.2 sends its two documented tiers explicitly (upstream defaults
  to max when the parameter is omitted) and defaults to max as Z.ai
  recommends; GLM-5-Turbo no longer advertises effort control it does not
  support; and the cross-vendor DeepSeek/GLM models resold through the
  Alibaba plan gain the high/max ladder DashScope documents for them.
  The opencode Go models take their ladders from opencode's own model
  registry (Grok low/medium/high; GLM-5.2 and DeepSeek V4 Pro high/max;
  DeepSeek V4 Flash low/high/max; HY3 low/high; Kimi K3 max-only; GPT 5.6
  Luna low through max), passed through verbatim since the gateway validates
  these values itself. Providers whose thinking control is binary or
  undocumented (Qwen via DashScope, Ollama Cloud, MiniMax, MiMo, Kimi K2.x)
  intentionally keep a single level.

- **Curated models now carry user-provided metadata, including reasoning
  efforts.** `bin/curate-models` asks for each new model's context window,
  image support, and reasoning efforts (so curated models get the effort
  switcher in the Codex picker), with `--efforts` available for the
  non-interactive `--models` form. Every value defaults conservatively and
  stays editable in `user-models.json`. No online metadata catalog is
  consulted — the provider's own `/v1/models` endpoint decides which models
  exist, and the metadata is yours.

- **New Meta Model API provider.** The `meta` provider (shown as "Meta API")
  routes the Responses protocol to `https://api.meta.ai/v1` with a stored
  `META_API_KEY`. Three Muse Spark models ship in the registry: 1.2, its
  cheaper 1.2 Contributor tier (whose inputs and outputs Meta may use for
  training), and the previous-generation 1.1 — the 1.2 tiers with reasoning
  summaries enabled. More Meta models can be curated per machine with
  `bin/curate-models meta`.

- **opencode Go is one provider family everywhere.** The
  `opencode-go-messages` and `opencode-go-responses` protocol variants now
  declare `variantOf: "opencode-go"` in the registry, and provider selection
  treats the three as a single unit: enabling or disabling any of them toggles
  the whole family, the selection file stores only `opencode-go`, and every
  read expands it back to all variants. This retroactively fixes installs
  whose selection predates the variants — MiniMax, Qwen, and GPT 5.6 Luna
  models no longer vanish from the Codex picker while the other opencode Go
  models show. Setup, the tray, and `providers list` now show one
  **opencode Go** entry instead of three.

- **Removed the Cursor and opencode app targets.** The router now focuses on
  Codex only: `--target codex` is the sole installer target, the Cursor Chat
  Completions gateway and the opencode config manager/subagent generator are
  gone, and their port blocks (4104-4107, 4116, 4120-4126) are released. The
  opencode Go model subscription is unaffected — it remains a regular provider
  inside Codex. Anyone with a previously installed Cursor or opencode
  integration can remove the old service with that checkout's
  `model-router <target> uninstall` before updating.

- A **Show tray** mode in the macOS tray's Settings tab can tie the menu bar
  icon, Dynamic Island, and desktop panel to the Codex/ChatGPT desktop apps:
  the surfaces appear when either app launches and hide when the last one
  quits, while the tray process stays resident as the watcher. The default
  remains always-visible.

- The macOS tray registers itself as a login item on its first launch, so it
  reopens automatically after a reboot instead of requiring a manual
  `./bin/model-router-tray`. A **Start at login** toggle in the Settings tab
  (backed by `SMAppService`, also visible in System Settings › Login Items)
  controls it, and the automatic registration happens only once — disabling
  the item is never overridden.

- The opencode target now generates one subagent per selected model in
  opencode's config, and refreshes those entries when providers are enabled,
  disabled, or given new keys. `setup`, `doctor`, `status`, `enable`, `disable`,
  and `uninstall` all support `MODEL_ROUTER_TARGET=opencode` through
  `bin/model-router opencode ...`, and the opencode installer works from both
  `install.sh --target opencode` and `install.ps1 -Target opencode`.

- Fixed native OpenAI models disappearing from the Codex picker on Windows when
  the Codex CLI is installed through npm (#46). `where.exe codex` lists the
  extensionless POSIX shim before `codex.cmd`, and Node cannot spawn the former
  without a shell, so every probe threw ENOENT. The router now picks a shim Node
  can execute and runs `.cmd`/`.bat` through a shell with the path quoted.
- A Codex binary that cannot be spawned is no longer reported as a signed-out
  session. That conflation is what let one spawn error silently strip every
  native model from the catalog; the catalog build now refuses to run rather
  than guess, and the doctor reports the probe failure on its own line.

- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is documented as a `qwen-plan` credential alongside
  `QWEN_PLAN_API_KEY`, and the README now records that Qwen is key-only:
  Alibaba discontinued the Qwen Code OAuth free tier on 2026-04-15, so there is
  no OAuth path to add. Point `QWEN_PLAN_BASE_URL` at the DashScope
  compatible-mode endpoint to bill a pay-as-you-go key through the same
  provider.

- The Alibaba Model Studio plan provider (`qwen-plan`) now lists every chat
  model the Individual Plan serves, not just Qwen3.7: Qwen3.8 Max, Qwen3.8 Max
  Preview and Qwen3.6 Flash (all with vision input), plus the cross-vendor
  models the plan resells — DeepSeek V4 Pro, DeepSeek V4 Flash (0731) and
  GLM-5.2. The cross-vendor entries use the DashScope compatible-mode request
  profile rather than each vendor's native thinking profile, because DashScope
  rejects the vendor-specific parameters. The plan's speech, image and video
  models are deliberately not listed — they are not chat-completions models
  and would fail on every request from a model picker.

- API keys can now be replaced or removed from the desktop app and the macOS
  tray, not just the terminal. Each connected API provider gains a **Replace
  key** action and a confirmed **Remove** action; removing deletes the managed
  key files and hides the provider from the Codex model picker. If a key is
  also present in the macOS Keychain or the environment, the removal result
  says where it still resolves from instead of claiming a clean disconnect.
  `control credential <provider> --remove` exposes the same operation.

- The Dynamic Island setting is now a three-way mode: Off, Notch (the
  existing top-of-screen overlay), or Desktop — a draggable widget-style
  panel pinned just above the desktop icons that always shows live router
  activity, every connected provider's vendor quota bars with reset
  countdowns, and the 7-day token trend, with its position remembered.
- Added a Z.ai vendor quota adapter: when a `zai-coding` provider is
  configured, account usage now reports real plan windows (5-hour, weekly,
  token quota) with reset times from Z.ai's key-authenticated quota API,
  plus a dashboard link. Alibaba plan and Ollama Cloud accounts stay
  local-only by design — their vendor dashboards are session-gated and the
  router never imports browser cookies — but now carry a `dashboardUrl` so
  companion UIs can deep-link to the official usage pages.
- Service startup failures now include the underlying bounded, non-sensitive
  error message (for example which health check timed out or which service
  exited early) instead of a generic failure line.
- Canceling a generation (or any client disconnect mid-request) no longer
  flips router health into the eight-second error state, so tray and island
  status indicators stop flashing red on ordinary cancels. Errors the router
  or an upstream actually produced still surface.
- The hidden API-key prompt now confirms how many characters were captured
  after each entry, challenges input that looks like the same key pasted
  twice before saving, and re-prompts instead of failing on empty input, so a
  paste with terminal echo disabled is no longer a silent leap of faith.
- Guided setup now offers to build and launch the desktop companion app as a
  final step on macOS (menu bar, installed into `~/Applications`) and Linux
  (tray), with `--with-tray`/`--no-tray` overrides on `install.sh` and
  `bin/setup`. A missing toolchain or failed build warns and continues; it
  never fails the router install.
- Added an Ollama Cloud provider (`ollama-cloud`) with GLM-5.2, Kimi K2.7
  Code, MiniMax M3, and DeepSeek V4 Pro picker models, using ollama.com's
  OpenAI-compatible API with an account API key and context windows read from
  Ollama's published model metadata.
- Added a Qwen provider (`qwen-plan`) for Alibaba Model Studio Token and
  Coding Plan subscriptions with Qwen3.7 Max and Qwen3.7 Plus picker models,
  defaulting to the Singapore Token Plan endpoint with an environment override
  for other regions or plans.
- Added a Z.ai GLM Coding Plan provider (`zai-coding`) with GLM-5.2 and
  GLM-5-Turbo picker models. Requests use the plan's dedicated coding endpoint,
  enable thinking, map Codex's maximum reasoning tier to Z.ai's `max` effort,
  and drop sampling overrides that conflict with thinking mode.
- Added interactive model curation: `bin/curate-models PROVIDER` discovers the
  provider's live model list, lets the user toggle models the registry does
  not ship, and stores them as protected local user models with conservative
  default metadata. User models overlay the registry at load time; invalid or
  colliding entries are skipped with warnings instead of failing the router,
  and the command can rebuild routes and restart the service on request.
- Rebuilt the guided setup as a stepped wizard: numbered progress headers, a
  toggleable provider list with live ready/needs-key/needs-sign-in status,
  `a`/`n` select-all/none shortcuts, invalid-input recovery instead of
  aborting, color when the terminal supports it (respecting `NO_COLOR`), and a
  review summary with explicit confirmation before anything is installed.
- Guided Codex setup can now onboard Grok OAuth (and offers to `npm install`
  a missing official provider CLI), matching what the Cursor setup and tray
  already supported.
- Added a reversible tray toggle that lets signed-out Codex CLI/App sessions
  use connected external providers through a managed custom model provider,
  while preserving ChatGPT credentials and restoring the prior provider mode.
- The macOS login-free toggle now gracefully restarts the registered Codex app
  after applying or restoring its model-provider mode.
- Grok OAuth injects bare hosted `web_search` and `x_search` tools so xAI can
  run server-side realtime search agentically, matching Grok Build. Router-side
  search env filters and request search-parameter mapping were removed.
- Use Thinking Orbs `Shaping` while idle, `Thinking` while generating, and
  `Solving` for the Island's error indicator.
- Replace compact provider names with the providers' published marks and Codex
  session titles, add a plain `+N` concurrent-session indicator, and show dark
  hover rows with live status, elapsed time, daily usage, and ping-pong overflow
  for long titles.
- Added a native Windows and Linux tray companion with a seven-day token graph,
  connected-provider quota cards, secure onboarding, an animated top-center
  activity pill on Windows/X11, and an explicit tray-only Wayland fallback.
- Balanced the Dynamic Island with an animated status dot and slow idle
  heartbeat, a clearer localized pulse and edge comet during generation, and a
  one-shot line-chart draw while preserving Reduce Motion behavior.
- Restored the Dynamic Island's daily line graph with today's token total and
  provider quota percentage, while leaving longer-range controls in the tray.
- Hide tray usage cards until the corresponding OAuth session or API key is
  configured; enabled providers and historical local traffic no longer create
  disconnected-account cards.
- Cleaned up tray quota cards so each window has one standardized limit label
  and one reset line, with five-hour windows shown separately from weekly
  limits in both current and all-provider usage.
- Fixed All usage cards so local traffic with request counts no longer shows
  "No use", and local-only providers show "Local router traffic" instead of
  "No reset reported".
- Surface concurrent Codex model requests on the Dynamic Island: active count,
  multi-provider compact labels, and live request rows with elapsed time.
- Added a credential-isolated Anthropic API provider with Claude Opus 4.8 in
  the Codex picker, native Anthropic Messages forwarding, secure key setup,
  tray controls, and a real LiteLLM-to-mock-Anthropic Codex integration test.
- Added the macOS menu-bar control panel, all-provider usage grid, and optional
  Dynamic-Island-style activity overlay with secure provider onboarding.
- Made tray usage selection account-aware, added quota reset times to provider
  cards, and kept Kimi and Grok OAuth sessions fresh during usage polling and
  routed requests.
- Made macOS service reinstalls wait for launchd to finish unloading and use an
  in-place restart, preventing transient bootstrap status-5 failures.
- Serialized background-service changes and added bounded readiness checks so
  repairs cannot overlap or report failure while a healthy router is starting.
- Added a 30-second `Starting` grace state to the macOS tray so routine router
  recovery does not appear as an immediate failure.
- Added the isolated Cursor target and corrected its PowerShell installer path.
- Removed the experimental Claude Desktop router target while retaining the
  direct, credential-isolated Anthropic API provider for Codex and Cursor.
- Fixed partial startup failures so already-running forwarders are terminated,
  and isolated all six ports in the real LiteLLM integration test.
- Grok OAuth account usage now reads weekly/monthly credit limits from the official Grok CLI billing endpoint.
- Rewrote routed-model catalog identity text so external models no longer
  claim to be based on GPT-5 in Codex `base_instructions`.
- Hardened local caller authentication with a separate per-install capability,
  exact internal-key checks, authenticated credential-detail health endpoints,
  browser-request rejection, and fail-closed routing before request bodies or
  provider quota are touched.
- Protected Codex config and all config snapshots for the current user, and
  redacted the caller capability from status, migration, and support output.
- Replaced raw exception text in HTTP responses and service logs with bounded,
  non-sensitive errors.
- Fixed Windows private-file ACL grants for numeric user SIDs and corrected
  router-status detection for escaped Windows catalog paths.
