// still leave the router's own readiness allowance intact -- so widening it
// here would let a slow probe outlive the deadline of the operation that asked

// Measured 2026-09-23, on a Windows boot under logon load: every powershell.exe
// spawn exceeded fifteen seconds -- the private-file ACL helper, which allows
// 15s, logged `spawnSync powershell.exe ETIMEDOUT` twenty-two times in one boot
// window -- while this probe allowed five. start.mjs could not record its own
// identity, refused to run without a stoppable process record, and the task's
// one-minute heartbeat relaunched it into the same failure for forty minutes
// while the desktop client showed "Reconnecting... waiting for network". The
// same probes measure 0.9-1.6s on an idle host, which is why this only ever
// appeared after a restart. The 45s allowance matches the interpreter probe
// start.mjs runs through venv-runtime.mjs, which already treats a slow spawn as
// a scheduling artifact rather than a failure.
//
// The retry is deliberately not a silent fallback: a probe that answers with a
// non-zero exit is a decision, not a stall, and is returned as-is. Only a
// timeout -- where nothing was learned -- spends a second attempt.
