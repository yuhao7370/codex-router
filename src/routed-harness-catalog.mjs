// What each routed harness is told about the router, and where it is told it.
//
// Five clients — opencode, pi, omp, Command Code, and Hermes Agent — all offer
// the same thing: a user-owned configuration document with a mapping of custom
// providers in it. That similarity is why they share one publisher
// (`routed-harness-manager.mjs`) instead of getting five near-identical
// managers; this file is the part that genuinely differs, and it is data.
//
// Two rules shape every entry below.
//
// **The wire is one the router already serves.** The caller endpoint answers
// `/v1/responses` and, behind the `/anthropic` leaf, the Anthropic Messages
// API (`claude-surface.mjs`). Nothing else. A harness that speaks Responses is
// pointed at the former; a harness that does not is pointed at the latter with
// `claude-model-id.mjs` ids, because that surface exists precisely so a
// non-Codex client can reach every routed model. No entry here invents a third
// protocol and hopes.
//
// **The capability is the URL, not the key.** The caller secret is a path
// segment (`caller-auth.mjs`), so a bearer is redundant: the request is already
// authorized by the time a header is read. Where a harness treats a keyless
// provider as first-class it is declared keyless; where a harness hides
// keyless models from its own picker, the same secret is repeated in the field
// it looks at. Both are noted per entry, because the difference is not
// cosmetic — it decides whether the models show up at all.

// model of a `{ context }`-only publish. The router has no per-model output cap
// to report, but it does know where Codex compacts (`autoCompact`). opencode
// compacts at `limit.input` less a small reserve when `input` is set, so
// `input` is that threshold and `output` is the headroom the registry leaves
