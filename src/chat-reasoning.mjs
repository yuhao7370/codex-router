// thinking model reached over Chat Completions emits `reasoning_content` and
// expects it back on the assistant turn that produced it; replayed as visible
// text instead, the model reads its own past thinking as prose it once said,
// moves new thinking into the answer channel, and loops on its last progress
// note (Hy4 on opencode Go, rollout 01a0928e, 12 September 2026: reasoning
// tokens 174 -> 0 in one step, then the same sentence 2, 4, 5, 8, 16 times).
// The profile checks below cover the vendor-direct routes; the family table
// covers the same models behind resellers, whose request profiles say nothing
// about the upstream's replay rule.
