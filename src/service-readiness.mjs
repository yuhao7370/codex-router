 * instance enumeration, and a direct scan for a live process whose command
 * line references the generated launcher. Once both stop reporting a live
 * launch for longer than the launch grace, readiness fails with the task's
 * own result instead of polling health for the full budget. A query failure
 * is inconclusive and never fails the wait by itself.
