//
//   * a record whose own AGE exceeds the largest step is expired. That single
//     rule releases in both skew directions -- a clock that jumped backwards
//     makes the age negative, and a clock that jumped forwards makes it huge --

//     legitimate record can carry;
//   * the remaining wait is clamped to that same step, so a structurally
//     corrupt instant cannot be reported as a longer wait than the schedule
//     allows.
//
// Together they bound the automatic refusal to one step past the last recorded
// failure. Without them, a skewed or hand-edited record refuses automatic starts
// for as long as the skew lasts, and the only escapes are an explicit command or
